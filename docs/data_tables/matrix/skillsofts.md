# Skillsofts

Skillsoft programs provide recorded skill knowledge and muscle memory. When used with proper augmentations, skillsofts allow characters to perform skills they've never learned. Tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way.

## Skillsoft Types

### Activesofts

Replace physical active skills (every Active skill not based on Magic or Resonance). A skillwire system is needed to translate the 'softs into usable muscle memory. The number of skills usable at once is limited by the skillwires rating.

### Knowsofts

Replicate Knowledge skills, actively overwriting the user's knowledge with their own data. Must be accessed with a skilljack, and the number usable at once is limited by the skilljack.

### Linguasofts

Replicate language skills, allowing a user to speak a foreign language by automatically translating signals from the speech cortex. Chipped speech can be awkward and stilted. Must be accessed with a skilljack, which limits how many skillsofts you can use at a time.

## Notes

- When a skill test is called for, the character may use the skillsoft rating in place of the skill
- Tests made with a skillsoft may not be boosted with Edge in any way
- Skillsofts aren't educational tools; you can't actually learn from them
