### Mapsofts

Feature detailed information about a particular area, from streets to business/residential listings to topographical, census, GPS and environmental data. An interactive interface allows you to quickly determine the best routes and directions, locate the nearest spot of your choice, or create your own customized maps.

### Agents

Autonomous programs rated from 1 to 6. Each agent occupies one program slot on your deck. Agents use the Matrix attributes of the device they run on, and their rating (up to 6) for attributes. Agents have Computer, Hacking, and Cybercombat skills at a rating equal to their own. An agent can perform Matrix actions for you and has its own persona and icon. Any attack on an agent damages the device on which it is running.
