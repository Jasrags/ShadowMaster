## Priority Inference

### Attribute Points Calculation

| Attribute | Value | Human Base | Points Purchased |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Body      | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Agility   | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Reaction  | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Strength  | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Willpower | 5     | 1          | 4                |
| Logic     | 5     | 1          | 4                |
| Intuition | 6     | 1          | 5                |
| Charisma  | 4     | 1          | 3                |
| **Total** |       |            | **24 points**    |

**Analysis:** 24 points exceeds Priority C (16) but is less than Priority A (24). Wait, 24 matches Priority A exactly!

Actually, looking at this more carefully:

- Priority A Attributes = 24 points
- Priority B Attributes = 20 points
- Priority C Attributes = 16 points
- Priority D Attributes = 14 points

24 points → **Priority A (Attributes)**

### Skills Calculation

**Skill Groups:**
| Skill Group | Rating | Points |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| Athletics | 1 | 1 |
| Influence | 4 | 4 |
| **Total** | | **5** |

**Individual Skills:**
| Skill | Rating | Points |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| Compiling | 3 | 3 |
| Computer | 4 | 4 |
| Cybercombat | 4 | 4 |
| Decompiling | 2 | 2 |
| Electronic Warfare | 6 | 6 |
| First Aid | 1 | 1 |
| Hacking | 4 | 4 |
| Hardware | 2 | 2 |
| Navigation | 1 | 1 |
| Pilot Aircraft | 1 | 1 |
| Pilot Ground Craft | 1 | 1 |
| Pilot Watercraft | 1 | 1 |
| Pistols | 2 | 2 |
| Sneaking | 2 | 2 |
| Software | 4 | 4 |
| **Total** | | **38** |

**Analysis:**

- Individual skill points: 38
- Skill group points: 5

Checking priorities:

- Priority A Skills = 46/10
- Priority B Skills = 36/5
- Priority C Skills = 28/2
- Priority D Skills = 22/0

38 individual points exceeds Priority B (36). With 5 group points, this suggests:

- Use Priority B Skills (36/5) + 2 karma-purchased skill points

**Wait** - Technomancer Priority A gives 2 skills at Rating 5. Let me re-check:

From the stat block, Electronic Warfare 6 is the highest skill. The Technomancer at Priority A gets:

- Resonance 5
- 5 Complex Forms
- 2 skills at Rating 5

This means Electronic Warfare 5 and one other skill at 5 could come from Resonance priority. Electronic Warfare 6 requires 1 more point (5→6 = 12 karma or priority points).

Let me recalculate without the 2 free Rating 5 skills:

- 38 - 10 (two Rating 5 skills from Resonance priority) = 28 individual points
- With 5 group points: matches Priority C (28/2)? No, Priority C only gives 2 group points.

Actually Priority B gives 36/5. If we have 38 individual skill points but 2×5=10 come free from Resonance A, that's 28+10=38. We need to account for the 6th rating of E-War.

Let me approach this differently - the priority likely is:

- **Priority B Skills (36/5)** - the two Rating 5 skills from Resonance A would be Compiling 3 and Decompiling 2 (the Resonance-linked skills), not arbitrary skills.

Actually re-reading Priority A Resonance: "2 skills at rating 5" - these are Matrix skills. Looking at the character:

- Electronic Warfare 6 (could be 5 from Resonance + 1 purchased)
- Hacking 4

So more likely:

- Priority A Resonance gives Electronic Warfare 5 + Hacking 5
- Current Hacking is only 4, so maybe Software 5?
- E-Warfare 6 = 5 (free) + 1 (purchased)

Adjusting calculation:

- Free from Resonance A: 2 skills at 5 = 10 points
- Need to purchase: 38 - 10 = 28 points + the extra point for E-War 6

This suggests **Priority B Skills (36/5)** with some creative accounting.

| Low Lifestyle (2 months) | 2   | 2,000¥    | 4,000¥   |
| **Gear Subtotal**        |     |           | ~19,470¥ |

**Weapons:**
| Weapon | Cost |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Colt America L36 | 325¥ |
| Spare Clip | 5¥ |
| Regular Ammo×110 | 44¥ |
| Knife | 10¥ |
| **Subtotal** | ~384¥ |

**Total Resources:** ~19,854¥

**DISCREPANCY DETECTED:** This exceeds Priority E Resources (6,000¥) significantly!

**Analysis:** The character requires karma-to-nuyen conversion or the original file was wrong about Priority E Resources. At Standard level, up to 10 karma can convert to 20,000¥. With Priority E (6,000¥) + 10 karma (20,000¥) = 26,000¥ budget, which works.

However, looking at the Fake SIN Rating 3 alone at 7,500¥, this suggests a different resource allocation. Let me reconsider priorities.

### Magic/Resonance Calculation

**Path:** Technomancer
**Resonance:** 5

From stat block:

- Complex Forms: Cleaner, Data Mask, Editor, Pulse Storm, Resonance Spike (5 forms)
- Matrix Init: 10 + 3D6 (matches Resonance 5 hot-sim: Data Processing + Intuition + 3D6)

**Priority A Resonance (Technomancer):**

- Resonance 5 ✓
- 5 Complex Forms ✓
- 2 skills at Rating 5

This matches **Priority A (Resonance)**.

### Metatype Calculation

**Metatype:** Human
**Edge:** 3
**Special Attribute Points:** Edge 3 - Human base Edge 1 = 2 points purchased with special

Human at different priorities:

- Priority A: 9 special points
- Priority B: 7 special points
- Priority C: 5 special points
- Priority D: 3 special points
- Priority E: 1 special point

With Edge 3 and Resonance 5 (from Resonance priority), special points only go to Edge.
Edge costs: 1→2 (1 point), 2→3 (1 point) = 2 special attribute points

This matches **Priority D or E** for Human (both provide enough for Edge 3).

### Priority Summary

| Priority | Category   | Confidence | Notes                                      |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A        | Resonance  | 100%       | Technomancer, RES 5, 5 CFs, 2 skills at 5  |
| B        | Skills     | 90%        | 36/5 + karma purchases                     |
| C        | Metatype   | 95%        | Human with 5 special (Edge 3 = 2 pts used) |
| D        | Attributes | 85%        | 14 points (need karma for 10 more)         |
| E        | Resources  | 80%        | 6,000¥ + karma-to-nuyen                    |

**Alternative interpretation:** The existing file shows Priority D Attributes (14 points), which would require significant karma expenditure for the remaining 10 attribute points. At 5 karma per point, that's 50+ karma, which exceeds starting karma.

Let me recalculate with the assumption that the existing file's priorities are correct:

If Priority D Attributes (14 points):

- 24 needed - 14 available = 10 points by karma
- 10 attribute points × (avg 7 karma each) = ~70 karma - NOT FEASIBLE

**Revised Analysis:** The character MUST have higher attribute priority. Let me assume:

- **Priority A: Resonance** (Technomancer)
- **Priority B: Skills** (36/5)
- **Priority C: Metatype** (Human, 5 special)
- **Priority D: Attributes** (14 points) - INSUFFICIENT
- **Priority E: Resources** (6,000¥)

This doesn't work mathematically. The stat block must use:

- **Priority A: Resonance** OR **Attributes**

Given the Technomancer concept REQUIRES Priority A Resonance, the only solution is karma conversion for attributes.

Let me try:

- A: Resonance
- B: Attributes (20 points) - need 4 more by karma
- C: Metatype (Human, 5 special)
- D: Skills (22/0) - need ~16 more skill points by karma
- E: Resources (6,000¥) + karma conversion

**Final Priority Assessment:**

| Priority | Category   | Value               |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------- |
| A        | Resonance  | Technomancer, RES 5 |
| B        | Skills     | 36/5                |
| C        | Metatype   | Human (5 special)   |
| D        | Attributes | 14 points           |
| E        | Resources  | 6,000¥              |

| **Total Spent**          |                                                         | 32   |         |
| **Net (with negatives)** | 25 - 32 + 27 = 20 remaining?                            |      |         |

**DISCREPANCY:** The karma math doesn't balance properly. Let me recalculate:

Starting: 25 karma

- Negative Qualities: +27 karma (but capped at 25)
  = 50 karma (but negatives capped, so 25 + 25 = 50)

* Positive Qualities: -25 karma
* Remaining: 25 karma

From 25 remaining:

- Karma-to-Nuyen: Needed 19,854¥ - 6,000¥ (Priority E) = 13,854¥
- At 2,000¥ per karma: 13,854 / 2,000 = 6.9 → 7 karma (gives 14,000¥)
- Available after conversion: 6,000¥ + 14,000¥ = 20,000¥

**Still short by ~4,000¥.** This suggests either:

1. Some karma was spent on attributes (10 points needed if Priority D)
2. The priority structure is different

Let me try Priority B Skills (36/5) + Priority D Attributes (14):

Attributes needed: 24 points
Priority D provides: 14 points
Shortfall: 10 points × ~7 karma avg = 70 karma - NOT POSSIBLE

**Conclusion:** The stat block as printed may contain minor inconsistencies typical of published archetypes. The most likely scenario:

- Priority A: Resonance (required for Technomancer concept)
- Priority B: Attributes (20 points)
- Priority C: Metatype (Human, 5 special)
- Priority D: Skills (22/0)
- Priority E: Resources (6,000¥)

With this arrangement:

- Attributes: 20 base + 4 karma (20 karma) = 24 ✓
- Skills: 22/0 + karma purchases

### Initiative

| Type                 | Value | Dice | Notes              |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---- | ------------------ |
| Physical             | 9\*   | 1D6  | REA 3 + INT 6      |
| Matrix (AR)          | 9     | 1D6  | Same as physical   |
| Matrix (Cold-Sim VR) | 11    | 3D6  | DP 5 + INT 6       |
| Matrix (Hot-Sim VR)  | 11    | 4D6  | DP 5 + INT 6, +1D6 |

\*Combat Paralysis: Act last in first combat round, -3 to Initiative

**Note:** Stat block shows Physical Init 8+1D6 and Matrix Init 10+3D6, suggesting:

- Physical: REA 3 + INT 6 = 9 (stat block shows 8 - may be typo or Combat Paralysis already factored)
- Matrix (VR): DP 5 + INT 6 - 1 = 10? Or using Cold-Sim formula

## Notes

### Tactical Considerations

- **Combat Paralysis** is a significant weakness - avoid direct combat situations
- **Home Ground (NeoNET)** provides +2 dice when operating in former employer's systems
- **Codeslinger (Snoop)** makes this character an excellent surveillance operative
- **Insomnia** can cause fatigue penalties if not carefully managed
- Micro-drones provide physical world surveillance capability
- Living Persona ASDF (4/6/5/5) is competitive with mid-range cyberdecks

### Background Hooks

- Former NeoNET employee with insider knowledge
- Vocal prejudice against NeoNET citizens suggests traumatic history
- Fellow Technomancer contact provides community support
- Finance/Economics knowledge suggests corporate background
- BTL dealer contact hints at escapist tendencies or information source

### Sprite Capabilities

As a Technomancer, this character can compile and register:

- **Data Sprites:** Information gathering and analysis
- **Crack Sprites:** Breaking Matrix security
- **Fault Sprites:** Disrupting devices and icons
- **Machine Sprites:** Controlling and enhancing devices
