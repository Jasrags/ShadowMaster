| Armor        | Rating | Capacity | Cost   |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------ |

| **Total**    | 13\*   |          | 1,000¥ |

\*Note: Stat block shows Armor 13, but Armor Jacket provides 12. The +1 may be from gear not explicitly listed (possible clothing with armor value).

### Electronics

| Item               | Rating/Capacity | Cost | Notes                |
| ------------------ | --------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| Contacts (optical) | Capacity 2      | 200¥ | Vision Enhancement 2 |

## Weapons

### Ranged Weapons

| Weapon           | Type         | Acc | DV  | AP  | Mode | RC  | Ammo  | Cost |

| Colt America L36 | Light Pistol | 7   | 7P  | —   | SA   | —   | 11(c) | 320¥ |

**Colt America L36 Ammunition:**

- Regular Rounds ×75 (150¥ for 80 rounds = 8 × 10-round boxes)

**Note:** Stat block says "75 rounds" - purchased as 8 boxes of 10 (80 rounds) at 20¥ per box = 160¥

### Melee Weapons

| Weapon       | Type  | Reach | Acc | DV  | AP  | Cost |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | ---- |
| Combat Knife | Blade | —     | 6   | 7P  | -3  | 300¥ |

**Note:** Stat block shows Combat Knife DV 7P, AP -3. Database shows "(STR+2)P" which at STR 3 = 5P. The 7P in the stat block may be an error or assume augmented STR or different base.

## Priority Inference

### Attribute Points Calculation

| Attribute | Value | Human Base | Points Purchased |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Body      | 5     | 1          | 4                |
| Agility   | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Reaction  | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Strength  | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Willpower | 4     | 1          | 3                |
| Logic     | 5     | 1          | 4                |
| Intuition | 3     | 1          | 2                |
| Charisma  | 2     | 1          | 1                |
| **Total** |       |            | **20**           |

→ **Priority B (20 points)**

### Skills Calculation

**Active Skills from Priority:**

- Total skill ratings: 3+3+3+2+5+3+3+3+5+4 = 34
- Free skills from Magic A: Spellcasting 5 + Counterspelling 5 = 10
- Net purchased: 34 - 10 = 24

**Closest match:** Priority D (22 points) + 2 points from karma

**Skill Groups:** 0

→ **Priority D (22/0)** with 2 extra skill points purchased via karma

### Magic Calculation

- Magic Rating: 6
- Magical Path: Magician
- Free Spells: 10
- Free Skills: 2 magical skills at rating 5

→ **Priority A (Magician: Magic 6, 2 skills at 5, 10 spells)**

### Metatype Calculation

- Metatype: Human
- Edge: 2
- Special attribute points on Edge: Edge 2 - 1 (free) = 1 spent

Human at Priority C gets 5 special attribute points.
Human at Priority D gets 3 special attribute points.
Human at Priority E gets 1 special attribute point.

With Edge 2, only 1 special point is used on Edge (Edge starts at 1).

→ **Priority E (Human: 1 special)** would work if Edge 2 = 1 purchased
→ But need to verify Edge minimum is 1

Actually, Edge minimum at creation is 1 for all metatypes, and you spend special attribute points to increase it. So Edge 2 means 1 special point spent.

→ **Priority E (Human: 1 special attribute point)** ✓

### Resources Calculation

At Priority E: 6,000¥

**Problem Analysis:**
The gear total (~12,180¥) exceeds 6,000¥. This requires either:

1. Karma-to-Nuyen conversion (max 10 karma = 20,000¥ at Standard)
2. Resources at a higher priority

Since Magic must be A, Attributes must be B, and Skills seems to be D, that leaves only C and E for Metatype and Resources.

**Re-evaluation:**

- Priority A: Magic (required for Magic 6 + skills + 10 spells)
- Priority B: Attributes (20 points)
- Priority C: Metatype (Human with 5 special) or Resources (140,000¥)
- Priority D: Skills (22/0)
- Priority E: Metatype (Human with 1 special) or Resources (6,000¥)

With only Edge 2 (1 special point spent), Human at Priority E works.

**Resources Shortfall Resolution:**

- Priority E Resources: 6,000¥
- Actual gear: ~12,180¥
- Shortfall: ~6,180¥
- Karma-to-Nuyen: 4 karma = 8,000¥ (covers shortfall)

### Priority Summary

| Priority | Category   | Allocation                                   | Confidence |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| A        | Magic      | Magician (Magic 6, 2 skills at 5, 10 spells) | 100%       |
| B        | Attributes | 20 points                                    | 100%       |
| C        | Metatype   | Human (5 special attribute points)           | See below  |
| D        | Skills     | 22 points / 0 skill groups                   | 90%        |
| E        | Resources  | 6,000¥                                       | See below  |

**Priority C vs E Analysis:**

The character only uses 1 special attribute point (for Edge 2). This creates ambiguity:

**Option 1: Metatype C, Resources E**

- 5 special points available, 4 unused
- 6,000¥ + karma conversion needed

**Option 2: Metatype E, Resources C**

- 1 special point (exact match for Edge 2)
- 140,000¥ available (massive surplus)

Given the minimal gear loadout (mage with almost no equipment), **Option 1 (Metatype C, Resources E with karma conversion)** seems most likely. The unused special points could go to Edge (bringing it to 6) but the stat block shows Edge 2.

**Most Likely Interpretation:**

- Metatype C with 4 unspent special attribute points (unusual but valid)
- Resources E with ~4 karma converted to nuyen

## Karma Expenditure Validation

**Starting Karma:** 25 (Standard level)

| Category           | Items                                     | Cost | Running Total  |

| Positive Qualities | Focused Concentration 3 (12), HPT 1 (7)   | 19   | 19             |
| Negative Qualities | Distinctive Style (-5), Prejudiced (-3)   | -8   | 11             |
| Karma-to-Nuyen     | 4 Karma → 8,000¥                          | 4    | 15             |
| Skills             | 2 skill points above Priority D (2×2 = 4) | 4    | 19             |
| Contact Pool       | (free from CHA×3, no additional spending) | 0    | 19             |
| **Total Spent**    |                                           | 27   |                |
| **Net Karma**      | 25 - 27 + 8 (negative qualities)          | 6    | ✓ ≤7 carryover |

**Alternative Karma Path (if skills at 24 are priority-purchased):**

With Magic Priority A providing 2 free skills at rating 5, the character needs:

- 34 total skill points - 10 free = 24 points purchased
- Priority D provides 22 points
- 2 additional points = 4 karma (skill 0→1 = 2 karma each, or raising existing)

**Validation:**

- ✓ Positive qualities (19) ≤ 25 limit
- ✓ Negative qualities (8) ≤ 25 limit
- ✓ Karma-to-Nuyen (4) ≤ 10 limit (Standard)
- ✓ Remaining karma (6) ≤ 7 carryover limit

### Calculation Discrepancies

| Calculation        | Expected | Actual   | Notes                                       |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Armor Rating       | 13       | 12       | Armor Jacket provides 12; +1 source unclear |
| Combat Knife DV    | 7P       | (STR+2)P | At STR 3, should be 5P; stat block shows 7P |
| Resources vs. Gear | 6,000¥   | ~12,180¥ | Requires karma-to-nuyen conversion          |

### Stat Block Anomalies

1. **Armor 13:** The Armor Jacket provides 12 armor. The extra +1 is unexplained unless there's additional armor clothing.

2. **Combat Knife DV 7P:** The Combat Knife's damage formula is (STR+2)P. At STR 3, this equals 5P, not 7P. The stat block value may assume:
   - Higher effective STR (augmented or spell)
   - A typo in the sourcebook
   - A different weapon variant

3. **Edge 2 with Priority C Metatype:** If Human is at Priority C (5 special points), 4 points are unspent. This is unusual but technically valid.

## Starting Nuyen

**Range:** 80 + 180 = 260¥ to 80 + 1,080 = 1,160¥

## Notes

- Focused Concentration 3 allows sustaining 3 spells without penalty - excellent for buffing with Increase Reflexes, Increase Agility, and Combat Sense simultaneously
- "Troll Poser" distinctive style makes character memorable and easily identified; interesting roleplay choice for a mage
- Combat Sense provides +hits to defense tests when sustained - excellent defensive capability
- Strong offensive spell selection with both area (Ball Lightning, Manaball) and single-target (Stunbolt, Flamethrower, Clout) options
- High Pain Tolerance helps maintain spellcasting when wounded
- Drain pool of 9 dice (WIL + LOG) is solid for a combat mage
- Low essence 6.0 means full magical potential retained (no cyberware)
- Contact (Talismonger 3/3) is ideal for obtaining reagents and magical supplies
- The Prejudiced (Biased against elves) quality adds roleplay depth but may cause complications in mixed parties
