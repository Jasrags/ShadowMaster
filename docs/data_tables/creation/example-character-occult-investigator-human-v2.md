## Priority Selection

| Priority | Category        | Allocation                    |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| A        | Attributes      | 24 points                     |
| B        | Magic/Resonance | Magician (Magic 4, 10 spells) |
| C        | Skills          | 28 points / 2 skill groups    |
| D        | Resources       | 50,000¥                       |
| E        | Metatype        | Human (1 special attribute)   |

**Note:** This differs from a naive reading of the stat block. Priority B Magic provides Magic 4 (exact match) while Priority A Attributes provides 24 points (exact match). This avoids wasting Magic points and eliminates the need to purchase attributes with karma.

## Magic/Resonance

### Tradition

**Shamanic Tradition** (implied by Mentor Spirit Snake)

- Drain Attribute: Willpower + Charisma

### Magic Rating

**Magic 4** — directly from Priority B Magician (no reduction needed)

### Spells Known (8 of 10 — optimized for Alchemy)

These are **spells** the character knows, not preparations. Alchemical preparations are created during gameplay by using the Alchemy skill to imbue a known spell into a physical object (lynchpin).

| Spell             | Category     | Range | Drain | Alchemy Notes                          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----- | ----- | -------------------------------------- |
| Analyze Truth     | Detection    | Touch | F-2   | Excellent for investigation preps      |
| Armor             | Health       | Touch | F-2   | Defensive prep for team members        |
| Clairvoyance      | Detection    | Touch | F-3   | Remote surveillance via Time trigger   |
| Detect Individual | Detection    | Touch | F-3   | Tracking prep with Contact trigger     |
| Flamethrower      | Combat       | Touch | F-3   | Offensive prep with Contact trigger    |
| Heal              | Health       | Touch | F-4   | Emergency healing via Command trigger  |
| Physical Barrier  | Manipulation | Touch | F-1   | Tactical prep for ambush/escape        |
| Stealth           | Illusion     | Touch | F-3   | Infiltration prep with Command trigger |

**Note:** Priority B grants 10 spells; only 8 used. 2 additional spells could be selected.

#### Alchemy & Preparations (Gameplay Mechanic)

This character specializes in creating **alchemical preparations** — spells stored in physical objects for later activation. During gameplay:

1. **Create Preparation:** Roll `Alchemy (5) + Magic (4) [Force]` vs Force
2. **Choose Trigger Type:**
   - **Command** (+2 DV): Mental activation at will
   - **Contact** (+1 DV): Activates on touch (thrown weapons, tripwires)
   - **Time** (+2 DV): Delayed activation (surveillance, traps)
3. **Potency:** Net hits become the activation dice pool
4. **Decay:** Potency decreases over time (preparations are temporary)

With Alchemy 5 + Magic 4 + Alchemy Focus 4 = **13 dice** for preparation creation, this character can reliably create potent preparations for investigative work.

## Skills

### Skill Purchase Order of Operations

Priority C provides 28 individual skill points and 2 skill group points. The character needs 35 rating points plus 2 specializations.

**Optimization Principles:**

1. **Use skill points for specializations** (1 point each) instead of karma (7 karma each)
2. **Use karma for cheap rating purchases** (0→1 costs 2 karma) instead of expensive ones (4→5 costs 10 karma)

This follows the same logic as "free spells" - maximize use of priority resources before karma.

#### Step 1: Allocate Skill Points for Specializations (2 points)

Specializations cost 1 skill point during creation (vs. 7 karma):

| Specialization        | Skill Points |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| Arcana (Spirits)      | 1            |
| Impersonation (Human) | 1            |
| **Total**             | **2**        |

**Savings:** 14 karma (2 specs × 7 karma each)

#### Step 2: Karma Purchases (9 skills at Rating 1)

With 2 points used for specializations, only 26 skill points remain for ratings.
Need 35 rating points, so 9 must come from karma:

| Skill           | Purchase | Karma Cost |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Alchemy         | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Arcana          | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Banishing       | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Binding         | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Clubs           | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Counterspelling | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Impersonation   | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Perception      | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| Summoning       | 0 → 1    | 2          |
| **Total**       |          | **18**     |

#### Step 3: Priority Point Allocation (26 points)

Use remaining skill points for ratings above 1:

| Skill           | From | To  | Points |
| --------------- | ---- | --- | ------ |
| Clubs           | 1    | 2   | 1      |
| Binding         | 1    | 3   | 2      |
| Impersonation   | 1    | 3   | 2      |
| Arcana          | 1    | 4   | 3      |
| Banishing       | 1    | 4   | 3      |
| Counterspelling | 1    | 4   | 3      |
| Alchemy         | 1    | 5   | 4      |
| Perception      | 1    | 5   | 4      |
| Summoning       | 1    | 5   | 4      |
| **Total**       |      |     | **26** |

#### Step 4: Skill Group (2 points)

| Skill Group | Rating | Points |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| Influence   | 2      | 2      |

#### Skill Budget Summary

| Resource       | Available | Spent | Notes                 |
| -------------- | --------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| Skill Points   | 28        | 28    | 26 ratings + 2 specs  |
| Group Points   | 2         | 2     | Influence at Rating 2 |
| Karma (skills) | —         | 18    | 9 skills at Rating 1  |

**Comparison to Non-Optimized Approach:**

| Approach    | Specs Cost | Rating Karma | Total Karma  |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Optimized   | 2 SP       | 18 karma     | **18**       |

### Budget Analysis

| Item        | Karma  |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Available   | 46     |
| Spent       | 59     |
| **Deficit** | **13** |

**Optimization Impact:** Using skill points for specializations saves 10 karma compared to the naive approach (28→18 for skills+specs), reducing the deficit from 23 to 13.

**Resolution Options:**

1. **Use lower force foci** (F3 each):
   - Alchemy F3: 9 karma bonding (saves 3)
   - Counterspelling F3: 6 karma bonding (saves 2)
   - Total savings: 5 karma → Deficit: 8
2. **Remove one focus entirely**:
   - Drop Counterspelling F4: saves 8 karma → Deficit: 5
   - Or drop Alchemy F4: saves 12 karma → Deficit: 1
3. **Combination approach**:
   - Alchemy F3 (saves 3) + Counterspelling F3 (saves 2) + Drop Bad Luck quality (loses 12 karma) = breaks even

**Most Likely Explanation:** The original stat block assumes foci are acquired post-creation or represents a character after some advancement. For strict creation compliance, recommend:

- Reduce Alchemy Focus to Force 3 (saves 3 karma bonding, still effective)
- Reduce Counterspelling Focus to Force 3 (saves 2 karma bonding)
- This brings deficit to 8 karma, close enough for a GM to allow or acquire one focus post-creation

| v2      | 2026-01-30 | Corrected priority configuration (Magic B, Attributes A); added skill purchase order of operations for karma optimization; updated karma budget analysis                                           |
