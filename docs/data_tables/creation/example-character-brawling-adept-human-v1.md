| **Total** |         |            | **24 points**    |

→ **Priority A (24 points)** ✓

### Skills Calculation

**Individual Skills (not in groups):**

- Archery 4 + Blades 4 + Clubs 4 + Computer 1 + Con 1 + Disguise 1 + Escape Artist 3 + Etiquette 2 + First Aid 1 + Intimidation 3 + Lockpicking 2 + Negotiation 1 + Perception 3 + Sneaking 4 + Throwing Weapons 3 + Unarmed Combat 6 = **43 points**

**Skill Groups:**

- Athletics 4 + Outdoors 1 = **5 group points**

→ **Priority B (36/5)** - Character uses 43 skill points + 5 group points

**Note:** The 43 skill points exceeds 36, but Priority C Magic provides 1 skill at rating 2, which accounts for part of the difference. Alternatively, karma may be spent on skills.

- **Power Points:** 5 PP

→ **Priority C (Adept, Magic 4, 1 skill at 2)**

| **Total Spent**    |                                                                               | ~64  |               |

**Problem:** This analysis shows the character spending ~64 karma against a budget of 25+15=40 karma. The stat block appears to be slightly over-budget, which is common for archetype examples.

**Alternative Analysis (per existing Martial Artist file):**

The existing Martial Artist file notes that Magic 5 is "achieved through karma purchase" which would cost 25 karma. Combined with Edge 4, the character may have:

- Used the free skill from Magic priority C to cover 2 skill points
- The published archetype may have minor budget discrepancies (common in SR5)

**Validation:**

- ✓ Positive qualities (25) = 25 limit
- ✓ Negative qualities (15) ≤ 25 limit
- ? Skills may require karma beyond priority budget

## Notes

- Unarmed Combat at effective 9 dice (6 base + 3 Improved Ability) makes character extremely dangerous in melee
- Killing Hands allows unarmed attacks to deal Physical damage and bypass Immunity to Normal Weapons
- Critical Strike adds +2 DV to unarmed attacks (total 7P with STR 5)
- Code of Honor creates interesting roleplay opportunities and moral dilemmas
- Squatter lifestyle reflects the street-level vigilante concept
- Natural Athlete + Double-Jointed makes character excellent at parkour and escaping
- Triad contact provides underworld connections despite the moral code
- Low-Light Vision from Improved Senses helps in dark urban environments
