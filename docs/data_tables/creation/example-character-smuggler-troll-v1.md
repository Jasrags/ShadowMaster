# Smuggler - Troll

A troll smuggler/rigger specializing in vehicle operation across multiple platforms - ground, water, and air. This character combines a control rig with muscle toners for improved reflexes while maintaining a small fleet of armed vehicles. The Middle lifestyle with attached garage provides workspace for vehicle maintenance. The sunlight allergy encourages nighttime operations typical of smuggling runs.

### Attribute Points Calculation

| Attribute | Final | Troll Base | Points Spent |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Body      | 5     | 5          | 0            |
| Agility   | 2     | 1          | 1            |
| Reaction  | 5     | 1          | 4            |
| Strength  | 3     | 5          | 0 (at base)  |
| Willpower | 3     | 1          | 2            |
| Logic     | 2     | 1          | 1            |
| Intuition | 5     | 1          | 4            |
| Charisma  | 4     | 1          | 3            |
| **Total** |       |            | **15**       |

Note: STR 3 is below Troll base of 5. This may be a typo in the source - Trolls cannot have STR below 5. Using published stat as-is for accuracy, but actual character would need STR 5 minimum.

**Corrected Calculation (if STR at base 5):**
Total Points: 15 → Priority C (16 points) - close fit

### Special Attributes

| Attribute | Value | Notes                                    |
| --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Essence   | 4.9   | 6.0 - 1.1 (augmentations)                |
| Edge      | 1     | Troll base Edge (Priority B = 0 special) |
| Magic     | -     | Mundane                                  |

## Augmentations

### Cyberware

| Augmentation            | Grade    | Essence | Cost    | Notes                           |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------- |
| Control Rig (Rating 2)  | Standard | 1.0     | 97,000¥ | +2 vehicle tests when jumped in |
| Datajack                | Standard | 0.1     | 1,000¥  | Direct neural interface         |
| Muscle Toner (Rating 2) | Standard | 0.4     | 16,000¥ | +2 Agility (bioware)            |
| Smartlink               | Standard | 0.2     | 4,000¥  | +2 Accuracy with smartguns      |
| Smuggling Compartment   | Standard | 0.2     | 7,500¥  | Hidden storage (bioware)        |

Note: Muscle Toner and Smuggling Compartment are actually bioware, not cyberware.

**Total Essence Cost:** 1.9 → Remaining: **4.1**

**Essence Discrepancy:** Stat block shows 4.9 ESS, but calculated is 4.1. This may indicate:

- Some items are Alphaware grade (0.8× essence)
- Or different essence values in source material

If Control Rig 2 is Alphaware: 1.0 × 0.8 = 0.8 essence
Total with Alpha CR: 0.8 + 0.1 + 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.7 → Remaining: 4.3 (still doesn't match 4.9)

If Muscle Toner is also Alphaware: 0.4 × 0.8 = 0.32
Total both Alpha: 0.8 + 0.1 + 0.32 + 0.2 + 0.2 = 1.62 → Remaining: 4.38

**Using published value of 4.9 ESS**

| Pistols            | 3      | Agility          | 7         | -             |

**Total Skill Points:** 2+2+5+1+3+5+6+2+3 = **29 points**

**Priority Mismatch:** 29 points exceeds Priority D (22 points). This suggests either:

- Priority C Skills (28/2) is correct - but 29 > 28
- Some skills purchased with karma

**Karma Cost for Excess Skills:**
If Priority D (22 points): 29-22 = 7 points excess

- Most efficient: Buy rating 1 skill with karma = 2 karma

| Body      | 5     | 5          | 0      |

| **Total** |       |            | **15** |

\*STR 3 is impossible for Troll (min 5). Using as-is.

**Match:** 15 points → Priority C (16) or Priority D (14)

- Closest: Priority C (16 points), 1 under

### Skill Points Analysis

| Skill              | Rating |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Electronic Warfare | 2      |
| Etiquette          | 2      |

| Pilot Watercraft   | 2      |
| Pistols            | 3      |
| **Total**          | **29** |

**Match:** 29 points > Priority C (28/2)

- Priority C Skills = 28 points + 2 group points
- 29 - 28 = 1 point excess (Navigation 1 could be karma: 2 karma)

**Match:** 431K → Priority A (450,000¥)

### Metatype Analysis

- Metatype: Troll
- Edge: 1
- Special attribute points: 0 (Edge 1 is racial minimum)
- **Match:** Priority B (Troll with 0 special)

### Magic Analysis

- Mundane (no magic)
- **Match:** Priority E

### Priority Summary

| Priority | Category   | Confidence | Notes                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| A        | Resources  | 95%        | 431K within 450K budget |
| B        | Metatype   | 100%       | Troll with Edge 1       |
| C        | Skills     | 85%        | 29 pts (28+1 karma)     |
| D        | Attributes | 90%        | 15 pts (needs 14 for D) |
| E        | Magic      | 100%       | Mundane                 |

**Alternative (if STR issue resolved):**
If character has standard troll attributes, Priority C Attributes (16 pts) works better, requiring:

- A: Resources (450K)
- B: Metatype (Troll)
- C: Attributes (16 pts)
- D: Skills (22 pts) + karma
- E: Mundane

This requires 7+ more skill points from karma (expensive).

### Calculation Discrepancies

| Calculation     | Stat Block | Calculated | Discrepancy |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Essence         | 4.9        | 4.1        | 0.8         |
| STR (Troll min) | 3          | 5 (min)    | 2           |

### Notes on Discrepancies

1. **Essence 4.9 vs 4.1:** The 0.8 difference could indicate some augmentations are Alphaware grade, but even full Alphaware doesn't account for the full difference. Likely using different essence values from an errata or different source.

2. **STR 3 for Troll:** Trolls have a minimum STR of 5. The stat block value of 3 appears to be a printing error. Character should have STR 5.
