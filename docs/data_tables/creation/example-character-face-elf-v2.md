**Individual Skill Points:** 2+4+4+5+1+4+4+4+4+5+4+1+4+2 = **48**

Priority A provides 46 skill points. **Excess: 2 points** (purchased with karma).

### Skill Allocation Strategy (Karma-Optimal)

**Problem:** 48 skill points needed, only 46 from priority. Must buy 2 points with karma.

**Solution:** Allocate priority points to expensive skills first, buy cheapest skills with karma.

#### Priority Point Allocation (46 points)

| Skill              | Rating | Points | Source        |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------ | ------------- |
| Etiquette          | 5      | 5      | Priority      |

| **Subtotal**       |        | **46** | ✓ Exact match |

#### Karma Skill Purchases (2 points)

| Skill              | Rating | Karma Cost | Calculation |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| First Aid          | 1      | 2          | 0→1 = 1×2   |
| Pilot Ground Craft | 1      | 2          | 0→1 = 1×2   |
| **Total**          |        | **4**      |             |

### Shadow Master Entry Order

**IMPORTANT:** Enter skills in this order to ensure karma is spent optimally:

1. **Skill Groups first** (uses group points, not skill points):
   - Acting 4, Electronics 4, Stealth 2

2. **High-rated individual skills** (uses priority points):
   - Etiquette 5, Negotiation 5
   - All rating-4 skills (Clubs, E-War, Forgery, etc.)

3. **Medium-rated skills** (uses remaining priority points):
   - Blades 2, Unarmed Combat 2

4. **Rating-1 skills LAST** (these consume karma):
   - First Aid 1 (2 karma)
   - Pilot Ground Craft 1 (2 karma)

**If you run out of karma:** Go back and remove a rating-1 skill from priority allocation, then add those points to a higher-rated skill. The rating-1 skill will then be purchased with karma (cheaper).

## Karma Expenditure Validation

**Starting Karma:** 25 (Standard level)

| Category           | Items                                | Cost   | Running |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------- |
| Positive Qualities | Bilingual (5), First Impression (11) | 16     | 16      |
| Negative Qualities | Addiction (Mild, Alcohol)            | -4     | 12      |

| Skill Points       | First Aid 1 (2), Pilot Ground 1 (2)  | 4      | 25      |
| **Total Spent**    |                                      | **25** |         |

**Validation:**

- ✓ Positive qualities (16) ≤ 25 limit
- ✓ Negative qualities (4) ≤ 25 limit
- ✓ All karma accounted for (0 remaining)
- ✓ Karma carryover (0) ≤ 7 limit

**Karma Optimization Note:** The 2 excess skill points are allocated to rating-1 skills (First Aid, Pilot Ground Craft) because they cost only 2 karma each. If allocated to higher-rated skills, the karma cost would be prohibitive (e.g., 0→2 costs 6 karma, 4→5 costs 10 karma).

## Character Notes

1. **Social Focus:** First Impression quality (+2 dice on initial meetings) synergizes with high Charisma and social skills
2. **Contact Network:** Extensive contacts covering corporate (Mr. Johnson), government (City Official), entertainment (Club Owner, Media Producer), and street (Ganger, Ticket Scalper) sectors
3. **Electronic Warfare:** Bug Scanner, Area Jammer, White Noise Generator, and Tag Eraser provide counter-surveillance capability
4. **Infiltration:** Keycard Copier, Sequencer, and Lockpick Set enable physical infiltration
5. **Languages:** Cantonese/English (native) plus Japanese covers major business languages in the Pacific Rim
6. **Combat Capability:** Light - four pistols and basic melee for self-defense only
7. **Weakness:** Mild alcohol addiction can be leveraged by enemies
8. **Natural Low-Light Vision:** Elf racial trait for low-light conditions

### Build Optimization Notes

**Karma-Critical:** This character has exactly 0 karma remaining after all purchases. The build is only legal if skills are allocated in the correct order:

- **46 priority skill points** → High-rated skills (5s, 4s, 2s)
- **4 karma** → Rating-1 skills (First Aid, Pilot Ground Craft)

If you accidentally allocate priority points to First Aid and Pilot Ground Craft first, you'll need to buy higher-rated skills with karma, which costs more than the 4 karma available. See the "Shadow Master Entry Order" section above for the correct sequence.
