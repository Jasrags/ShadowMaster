## Notes

### Technomancer Capabilities

- **No Cyberdeck Required:** Living Persona provides Matrix attributes innately
- **Sprite Compilation:** Can create digital servants to assist with tasks
- **Complex Forms:** Resonance-based abilities that function like programs
- **Resonance Link:** Can perceive and interact with the Matrix directly

### Tactical Considerations

- **Combat Paralysis** is a significant weakness - avoid direct combat
- **Home Ground (NeoNET)** provides +2 dice advantage in former employer's systems
- **Codeslinger (Snoop)** makes excellent surveillance operative
- **Insomnia** can cause fatigue penalties if not managed
- Micro-drones provide physical surveillance capability
- Living Persona ASDF (5/6/5/5) is competitive with mid-range cyberdecks

### Background Hooks

- Former NeoNET employee with insider knowledge
- Vocal prejudice against NeoNET citizens suggests bad history
- Technomancer contact provides community support
- Finance/Economics knowledge suggests corporate background
