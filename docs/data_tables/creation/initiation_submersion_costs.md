## Discounts

### Ordeal (−10%)

An ordeal is a challenge or trial undertaken as part of the initiation process. Examples include:

- Fasting or meditation retreat
- Completing a dangerous magical quest
- Undergoing a symbolic death and rebirth ritual
- Creating a significant magical item

### Group Membership (−10%)

Being a member of a magical group (for Awakened) or network (for Technomancers) provides social and mystical support that eases the initiation process.

### Combined Discount (−20%)

Characters who both undergo an ordeal AND are members of an appropriate group receive a combined 20% discount.
