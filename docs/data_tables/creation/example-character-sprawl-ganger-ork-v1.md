**Skill Groups:**
| Group | Rating | Points (×5) |
| ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| Athletics | 2 | 10 |
| Mechanics | 1 | 5 |
| Stealth | 2 | 10 |
| **Subtotal** | | **25** |

**Note:** The stat block shows 44 individual skill points, but Priority B only provides 36. This suggests some skills may be purchased with karma or there's an error in the source material.

**Adjusted Calculation:**

- Priority B provides: 36 skill points + 5 group points
- Skill groups: Athletics 2 (2 pts) + Mechanics 1 (1 pt) + Stealth 2 (2 pts) = 5 group points ✓
- Individual skills needed: 44 points
- Excess: 44 - 36 = 8 points (requires 16 karma if purchased with karma)

**Validation:** Skills exceed Priority B by 8 points - requires karma purchase or source error

### Knowledge Skills

**Free Points:** (INT 3 + LOG 4) × 2 = **14 points**

## Augmentations

### Cyberware

| Augmentation     | Grade | Essence | Capacity | Cost    |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Obvious Cyberarm | Used  | 1.25    | 15       | 11,250¥ |

**Grade Calculation:**

- Base Cost: 15,000¥
- Used Multiplier: ×0.75 = 11,250¥
- Base Essence: 1.0
- Used Multiplier: ×1.25 = 1.25

**Cyberarm Stats:**

- Base STR: 3
- Base AGI: 3
- Capacity: 15 (0/15 used - no enhancements listed)

**Total Essence Cost:** 1.25
**Remaining Essence:** 6 - 1.25 = 4.75

**Note:** The stat block shows ESS 4.8, which suggests either a calculation error or the cyberarm is standard grade (1.0 essence). Using Used grade as specified gives 4.75.

**Issue:** Character appears to be 5 karma over budget. Possible explanations:

1. Skill points miscounted in source material
2. Edge was provided by metatype priority (Ork at C = 0 special, so Edge 1 may cost karma)
3. Some skills should be at lower ratings

**Edge Consideration:**

- Ork at Priority C provides 0 special attribute points
- Edge 1 would cost 5 karma to purchase
- This makes the deficit worse: -10 karma

**Alternative Interpretation (if some skills are purchased with karma):**
Using karma-optimal allocation (buying rating-1 skills with karma):

- Buy First Aid 1 (2 karma), Throwing Weapons 1 (2 karma), Navigation 1 (2 karma), Armorer 1 (2 karma) = 8 karma for 4 points

This would still exceed budget. The archetype may have errata or uses house rules.

## Derived Stats

### Limits

| Limit    | Value | Calculation                                     |
| -------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Physical | 9     | [(STR 7 × 2) + BOD 7 + REA 4] / 3 = 8.33 → 9    |
| Mental   | 5     | [(LOG 4 × 2) + INT 3 + WIL 4] / 3 = 5           |
| Social   | 6     | [(CHA 4 × 2) + WIL 4 + ESS 4.75] / 3 = 5.58 → 6 |

### Initiative

| Type     | Value | Dice |
| -------- | ----- | ---- |
| Physical | 7     | 1D6  |

**Calculation:** REA 4 + INT 3 = 7

**Note:** Stat block shows "8 + 1D6" which would require REA + INT = 8. With REA 4 and INT 3 = 7, this is inconsistent.

### Condition Monitors

| Type     | Boxes | Calculation                    |
| -------- | ----- | ------------------------------ |
| Physical | 13    | 8 + (BOD 7 / 2) = 8 + 3.5 → 12 |
| Stun     | 10    | 8 + (WIL 4 / 2) = 8 + 2 = 10   |

**Note:** Stat block shows "13 / 10" for Physical/Stun. Physical should be 12 based on BOD 7, but the cyberarm may add +1 CM box (total 13). ✓

### Armor

| Rating | Source                 |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| 12     | Armor Jacket (12 base) |

## Priority Inference

### Summary

| Priority | Category   | Confidence | Evidence                         |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| A        | Attributes | 100%       | 24 points exact match            |
| B        | Skills     | 85%        | 36/5 with karma-purchased extras |
| C        | Metatype   | 100%       | Ork with Edge 1 (0 special)      |
| D        | Resources  | 95%        | ~43K spent of 50K budget         |
| E        | Magic      | 100%       | Mundane                          |

### Notes

The character as written slightly exceeds standard creation limits. This is common in published archetypes which sometimes use simplified or approximated builds.
