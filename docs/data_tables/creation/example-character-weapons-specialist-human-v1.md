- Logic 3: 3 - 1 = 2 points
- Intuition 3: 3 - 1 = 2 points

**Total: 20 points** → **Priority C (16 points) insufficient, need karma or reassess**

| Survival           | 2      |
| Throwing Weapons   | 3      |

**Total Individual Skill Points: 46** → Matches **Priority A (46 skill points)**

### Resources Calculation

| Category              | Subtotal      |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Cyberware             | 45,000¥       |
| Weapons               | ~35,000¥      |
| Ammunition            | ~11,000¥      |
| Armor                 | 500¥          |
| Gear & Electronics    | ~7,500¥       |
| Identities & Licenses | ~9,300¥       |
| Vehicle               | 25,000¥       |
| Lifestyle             | 2,000¥        |
| Drugs                 | 700¥          |
| **Total**             | **~136,000¥** |

→ **Priority B (275,000¥)** with significant remaining funds or **Priority C (140,000¥)**

_Analysis: The stat block indicates 4,800¥ + (4D6 × 100)¥ starting funds, suggesting Resources Priority B with a lot of gear already purchased._

### Metatype Calculation

- Metatype: Human
- Edge: 5
- Special attribute points at Priority D (Human): 3 points
- Edge 5 = 5 - 1 (base) = 4 points needed

**4 points needed but only 3 available at Priority D** → Requires 1 point from karma (10 karma for Edge 4→5)

### Magic Calculation

- Magical Path: Mundane
- **Priority E** (no magic required)

### Priority Summary

| Priority | Category   | Confidence | Notes                                   |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| A        | Skills     | 95%        | 46 skill points + 10 group points exact |
| B        | Resources  | 90%        | ~265K spent, fits 275K budget           |
| C        | Attributes | 85%        | 16 points + 4 from karma (20 karma)     |
| D        | Metatype   | 90%        | Human with 3 special + 1 from karma     |
| E        | Magic      | 100%       | Mundane                                 |

## Karma Expenditure Validation

**Starting Karma:** 25 (Standard level)

| Category             | Items                                                   | Cost    | Running     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Positive Qualities   | Bilingual (5), Code of Honor (15), Guts (10), HPT 1 (7) | 37      | 37          |
| Negative Qualities   | Addiction Mild (-4)                                     | -4      | 33          |
| Contact Pool (Free)  | CHA 3 × 3 = 9 (covers part of contacts)                 | 0       | 33          |
| Contacts (Extra)     | 20 total - 9 free = 11                                  | 11      | 44          |
| Attribute (Edge 4→5) | 5 × 5 = 25 (if purchased)                               | —       | —           |
| Knowledge Skills     | 4 extra points × 1 = 4 karma                            | 4       | 48          |
| **Net Before Adj**   | 25 - 48 + 4 (negative)                                  | **-19** | Over budget |

**Issue Detected:** This build exceeds standard karma by ~19 points. Possible explanations:

1. Some qualities may have been granted by GM fiat
2. This may be a Prime Runner build (35 starting karma)
3. Some attributes may come from the cyberarm rather than purchased

**Revised Analysis (Prime Runner @ 35 karma):**

| Category             | Cost | Running    |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| Positive Qualities   | 37   | 37         |
| Negative Qualities   | -4   | 33         |
| Contacts (11 extra)  | 11   | 44         |
| Knowledge Skills (4) | 4    | 48         |
| **Subtotal**         | 48   |            |
| **Available**        | 35   |            |
| **Deficit**          | 13   | Still over |

_Conclusion: This archetype likely has some GM-granted qualities or represents a slightly higher-powered starting character._
