- Individual Skills: 4+2+3+2+3+6+1+2+4+2+4+1+2+1+2+1+1+1+1 = **43 points**
- Priority B provides: 36 skill points + 5 group points
- **Discrepancy:** 43 individual skill points vs 36 available = **7 points over budget**

**Resolution:** 7 karma spent on skills (see Karma Expenditure below)

### Knowledge Skills

**Free Points:** (INT 4 + LOG 4) × 2 = **16 points**

| Skill               | Rating | Category | Points |

**Validation:** ✓ 15 points spent ≤ 16 available

### Languages

| Language   | Rating | Notes                      |
| ---------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| English    | N      | Native                     |
| Salish     | 2      | 2 knowledge points (above) |
| Sperethiel | N      | Bilingual quality (free)   |

**Note:** Salish 2 is listed separately from knowledge skills in stat block. Adding 2 points for Salish to knowledge total = 17 points. This exceeds the 16-point budget by 1 point.

**Revised Knowledge/Language Allocation:**

- Free points: 16
- Used: Politics 2 + Salish-Sidhe Nation 3 + Sprawl Life 4 + Tarislar 4 + Tír Tairngire 2 + Salish 2 = 17
- **1 point over budget** - likely 1 karma spent or GM allowance

| Spell Focus (Health)    | varies       | varies | varies | Bonded focus (see below)  |

**Spell Focus Note:** The stat block lists "spell focus (Health)" but doesn't specify Force. Given the tight budget, likely Force 1:

- Spell Focus (Health) Force 1: Cost = 4,000¥ × 1 = 4,000¥
- This would exceed the 6,000¥ budget significantly.

**Possible interpretations:**

1. Focus is unbonded (no nuyen cost at creation, only karma to bond later)
2. Focus was acquired through roleplay/backstory
3. Budget discrepancy in published archetype

For this import, assuming **unbonded focus** (0¥ cost, requires karma to bond post-creation)

**Priority E Resources:** 6,000¥
**Discrepancy:** 14,700¥ - 6,000¥ = **8,700¥ over budget**

### Budget Analysis

The published archetype significantly exceeds Priority E resources. Possible explanations:

1. **Fake SIN omission:** If the 7,900¥ Fake SIN package is provided via backstory/GM, remaining = 6,800¥ (still over)
2. **Karma-to-Nuyen conversion:** 4 Karma × 2,000¥ = 8,000¥ additional
3. **Published error:** CRB archetypes sometimes have budget inconsistencies

**Likely Resolution:** 4-5 Karma converted to Nuyen (8,000-10,000¥)

### Notes

1. **Published archetype budget issues:** The CRB Street Shaman exceeds Priority E resources significantly. This is a known issue with some published archetypes.

2. **Spell Focus ambiguity:** The stat block lists "spell focus (Health)" without Force rating. Assumed Force 1 for validation, but nuyen cost would require karma-to-nuyen conversion or GM fiat.

3. **Skill point overflow:** The character has 7 more individual skill points than Priority B provides. These must come from karma (approximately 14 karma at standard creation costs).
