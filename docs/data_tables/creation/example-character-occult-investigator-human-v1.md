## Magic/Resonance

### Tradition

**Shamanic Tradition** (implied by Mentor Spirit Snake)

- Drain Attribute: Willpower + Charisma

### Magic Rating

**Magic 4** — reduced from Priority A's base 6 due to:

- Priority A provides Magic 6
- Mentor Spirit (Snake) costs 5 Karma (not Magic reduction)
- **Note:** The stat block shows Magic 4, suggesting 10 karma was spent converting Magic points or this reflects adjustments

## Priority Inference

### Attribute Points Calculation

| Attribute | Value | Human Base | Purchased |
| --------- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Body      | 3     | 1          | 2         |
| Agility   | 3     | 1          | 2         |
| Reaction  | 4     | 1          | 3         |
| Strength  | 3     | 1          | 2         |
| Willpower | 5     | 1          | 4         |
| Logic     | 3     | 1          | 2         |
| Intuition | 6     | 1          | 5         |
| Charisma  | 5     | 1          | 4         |
| **Total** |       |            | **24**    |

**Note:** 24 points exceeds Priority B (20). Either:

- 4 attribute points were purchased with karma (4 × 5 = 20 karma), OR
- Priority A was taken for Attributes

### Skills Calculation

| Skill           | Rating | Notes       |
| --------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Alchemy         | 5      | Individual  |
| Arcana          | 4      | Individual  |
| Banishing       | 4      | Individual  |
| Binding         | 3      | Individual  |
| Clubs           | 2      | Individual  |
| Counterspelling | 4      | Individual  |
| Impersonation   | 3      | Individual  |
| Perception      | 5      | Individual  |
| Summoning       | 5      | Individual  |
| Influence       | 2      | Skill Group |
| **Total**       | 35/2   |             |

**Analysis:** 35 skill points + 2 group points. Priority A provides 46/10, Priority B provides 36/5, Priority C provides 28/2.

The 2 group points match Priority C exactly. The 35 individual points exceeds Priority C's 28 by 7 points.

### Magic Calculation

- **Magic Rating:** 4 (stat block shows M column = 4)
- **Priority A Magic:** Base 6, could be reduced to 4 via Edge purchases or adjustments
- **Spells:** 8 preparations known (≤ Magic×2 = 8 ✓)
- **Foci:** 2 foci, total Force 8 (≤ Magic×2 = 8 ✓)

### Resources Calculation

Total estimated: ~50,000-72,000¥ depending on vehicle cost interpretation.

Priority D provides 50,000¥, which is tight for this loadout.

### Metatype Calculation

- Metatype: Human
- Edge: 3 (from stat block)
- Priority E Human provides 1 special attribute point (Edge 2 base + 1 = 3)

Wait — Edge starts at 1 for humans, so 3 Edge = 2 special points spent.
Priority E provides 1 special, so additional points came from elsewhere.

### Priority Summary (Revised)

| Priority | Category   | Confidence | Notes                           |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| A        | Magic      | 90%        | Magician with 2 skills at 5     |
| B        | Attributes | 70%        | 24 points (20 base + 4 karma?)  |
| C        | Skills     | 80%        | 28/2 + 7 karma-purchased points |
| D        | Resources  | 60%        | 50K tight for loadout           |
| E        | Metatype   | 85%        | Human with 1-2 special points   |

**Problem:** 48 Karma spent exceeds 25 starting + 21 negative = 46 available.

**Possible Resolution:**

- Some skills may have been at lower effective cost
- Character may have been built at Prime Runner level (35 karma)
- Stat block may contain optimization errors
