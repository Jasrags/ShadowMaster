# Loyalty Rating Table

| Rating | Description |
| :----- | :---------- |
| 1 | *Just Biz.* The relationship is purely mercenary, based solely on economics. The people involved may not even like each other, and they won't offer any sort of preferential treatment. |
| 2 | *Regular.* The relationship is still all business, but the parties treat each other with a modicum of mutual respect. |
| 3 | *Acquaintance.* The people in the relationship are friendly, but calling them actual friends might be stretching it. The contact is willing to be inconvenienced in small ways for the character but won't take a fall for him. |
| 4 | *Buddy.* There's actual friendship here, or at least solid mutual respect. The contact will go out of his way for the character if needed. |
| 5 | *Got Your Back.* The parties know and trust each other, and have for some time. The contact will back the character even in risky situations. |
| 6 | *Friend for Life.* The contact and character will go to the wall for each other, if that's what it takes. |
