# Echoes

Echoes are special techniques learned through submersion that expand a Technomancer's Resonance capabilities.

## Core Echoes (SR5 Core Rulebook)

| Echo              | Effect                                                      | Restrictions                |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| Attack Upgrade    | Increase Living Persona's Attack rating                     | Can be taken multiple times |
| Firewall Upgrade  | Increase Living Persona's Firewall rating                   | Can be taken multiple times |
| Mind Over Machine | Use Mental limit instead of Social limit for Matrix actions | —                           |
| Neurofilter       | Add submersion grade to resist Matrix damage                | —                           |
| Overclocking      | Add submersion grade to Matrix Initiative                   | —                           |
| Resonance Link    | Maintain one additional registered sprite                   | —                           |
| Sleaze Upgrade    | Increase Living Persona's Sleaze rating                     | Can be taken multiple times |
| Skinlink          | Connect to devices by touch without wireless                | —                           |

## Echo Descriptions

### Attack Upgrade

**Restrictions:** Can be taken multiple times

Each time this echo is selected, the technomancer's Living Persona Attack rating increases by 1.

### Firewall Upgrade

**Restrictions:** Can be taken multiple times

Each time this echo is selected, the technomancer's Living Persona Firewall rating increases by 1.

### Mind Over Machine

**Restrictions:** None

When attempting Matrix actions that would normally use the technomancer's Social limit, they can use their Mental limit instead. This is particularly useful for actions involving deceiving hosts or personas.

### Neurofilter

**Restrictions:** None

When resisting Matrix damage (both biofeedback and normal Matrix damage), the technomancer adds their submersion grade to the resistance test.

### Overclocking

**Restrictions:** None

The technomancer adds their submersion grade to their Matrix Initiative. This applies in both AR and VR modes.

### Resonance Link

**Restrictions:** None

The technomancer can maintain one additional registered sprite beyond their normal Charisma-based limit. This can be taken multiple times.

### Sleaze Upgrade

**Restrictions:** Can be taken multiple times

Each time this echo is selected, the technomancer's Living Persona Sleaze rating increases by 1.

### Skinlink

**Restrictions:** None

The technomancer can connect to any device by touch without using wireless communication. This provides a direct connection that cannot be detected through Matrix perception.

## Submersion Requirements

To learn an echo:

1. Character must be a Technomancer (have Resonance attribute)
2. Character must complete submersion to gain a new grade
3. Each submersion grade allows learning one echo
4. Some echoes have additional restrictions (noted above)
