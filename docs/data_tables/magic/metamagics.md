## Metamagic Descriptions

### Adept Centering

**Restrictions:** Adepts and Mystic Adepts only

The adept can center to reduce negative modifiers affecting Physical skill tests. By taking a Simple Action to center, the character reduces any negative modifiers by their initiate grade for one Combat Turn. This can reduce penalties from wounds, environmental conditions, and other sources.

### Centering

**Restrictions:** Requires centering skill or action

When resisting Drain, the magician can add their initiate grade to the Drain Resistance test. This requires a centering action, which can be as simple as a gesture, spoken words, or a specific stance. The centering skill used does not affect the bonus.

### Fixation

**Restrictions:** None

Alchemical preparations normally begin to lose potency after (Potency) hours. With Fixation, the magician can extend this duration by spending Karma. Each point of Karma spent extends the duration by (initiate grade) hours.

### Flexible Signature

**Restrictions:** None

The magician can alter their astral signature to appear different from their normal signature. This adds the initiate grade to the threshold for anyone attempting to identify the character through their astral signature using Assensing.

### Masking

**Restrictions:** None

The magician can disguise their aura to appear mundane or as a different type of Awakened character. This is an Opposed test against Assensing. The magician adds their initiate grade to their dice pool for this test.

### Power Point

**Restrictions:** Adepts and Mystic Adepts only; can be taken multiple times

Each time this metamagic is selected, the adept gains 1 additional Power Point. This can be taken at each initiation, allowing an adept to accumulate Power Points beyond their Magic attribute rating.

### Quickening

**Restrictions:** None; costs Karma

The magician can make a sustained spell permanent by spending Karma equal to the spell's Force. The spell becomes self-sustaining and no longer requires concentration. Quickened spells still count against the magician's sustained spell limit for purposes of background count and other effects.

### Shielding

**Restrictions:** None

When using spell defense (Counterspelling to protect against incoming spells), the magician adds their initiate grade to their spell defense dice pool. This bonus applies to all characters being protected.

### Spell Shaping

**Restrictions:** None

The magician can reshape area-effect spells to exclude specific areas or targets. For each meter adjusted from the spell's normal area, the magician suffers a -1 dice pool modifier to the Spellcasting test.

## Initiation Requirements

To learn a metamagic:

1. Character must be Awakened (have Magic attribute)
2. Character must complete initiation to gain a new grade
3. Each initiation grade allows learning one metamagic
4. Some metamagics have additional restrictions (noted above)
