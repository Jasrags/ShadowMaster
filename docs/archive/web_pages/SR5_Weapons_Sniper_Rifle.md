Use the Longarms skill when firing sniper rifles. Firearm enthusiasts will be the first to tell you that sport and hunting rifles are technically not sniper rifles, but they are similar enough in terms of game statistics to be included here rather than in their own section. Sniper rifles can take top, barrel-, and underbarrel-mounted accessories.

Standard upgrades
:   Bipod, smartgun, sound suppressor

The definitive anti-material rifle, Barret has been producing world-class firearms for decades, the Model 122 replaces the Model 121 as the company’s top-line offering. The rifle continues to be fitted with a sound suppressor, smartgun system and a folding bipod to help enhance long-range accuracy.

- I’ve heard of shooter using these for some amazing shots, but I can’t see how you slip one into a good blind without getting caught.
  - Rock Pilot

- I’m not sure why you would want one in an urban setting, but we’ve used them as part of an anti-vehicle ambush.
  - Picador

- I’ve used a Barret a couple of times. There’s nothing like making an Azzie officer’s head explode to convince the rest of them to go away.

Modifiers
:   Rigid Stock with Shock Pad
:   **TOP**:Detachable Imaging Scope

Straddling the line between assault rifle and sniper rifle, the Crockett EBR features a burst fire mode. While it lacks the magazine capacity of a true assault rifle, and lacks the precision of a true marksman’s weapon, it makes up for this in versatility, being able to switch fluidly between a sniping role and a combat role as easy as flipping a switch. It comes equipped with a rigid stock with shock pad and a detachable imaging scope.

Standard upgrades
:   Shock pad

The Onotari JP-K50 has an unusual past, being originally conceived for the next round of the Euro Wars, which never came about. Or at least, haven’t yet. It was shelved for decades, and only recently came back into the production queue during the so-called Dragon Civil War. Able to switch between long-range fire against a single hard armored target (such as a dragon) or firing bursts against clusters (such as drakes), it was seen as a weapon that could be issued to entire squads. Not mass produced, but produced enough that cost trumped quality in many ways, the final result is a sort of super-sized assault rifle rather than the kind of high-quality precision design that Saeder-Krupp is world famous for.

- I had trouble believing that the dragon-run corp would create an anti-dragon gun, but then every mercenary that was hired to take out Alamais got to take one of these with them.
  - Stone

- And not a lot of them survived. Just sayin’.

Morgan Boone’s been the face of the Kentucky Long Rifle Company for decades, and his Pioneer 60 is a household staple in rural areas across the CAS and UCAS even if his company refuses to sell it to anyone in the NAN. Simple but effective, it’s a rugged design that’s perfect for someone that just wants to get out of the house for a weekend of drinking beer and popping off a few rounds into the local fauna.

- Boone’s got a powerful hate-on for the NAN, especially the Sioux. His ancestor’s rolling in his grave.
  - Stone

- He was in the army back in the day. He was in Denver when the war got called off and never got his chance to go fight. Sixty years later, he’s still waiting for that war.
  - Sticks

- He and Clayton Wilson used to be tight. Went on vacations together, took business trips together, even hired him on as a consultant for a year after Clay got forced out of Lone Star as a favor. He’s against “messing with God’s will,” and they stopped talking after Clay underwent léonization. Old Boone is just too mean to die.

Combat Turn
:   -1 Accuracy (Minimum 3) every Combat Turn used

Melee Combat
:   -2 Accuracy (Minimum 3) after being used for Melee Attack or Melee Depend

Recalibrate Weapon
:   1 Hour, No test

A legendary assassin’s weapon, this sniper rifle features a silencer, an imaging scope, and a rigid stock with shock pad. The SM–5 disassembles completely in order to fit into a standard briefcase; setting it up or breaking it down takes an Extended Firearms + Logic [Mental] (6, Complex Action) Test. While deadly, the SM–5 is fragile. At the end of every Combat Turn in which the weapon is used in a running firefight, reduce its Accuracy by 1 (to a minimum of 3). If the weapon is used in combat as a melee weapon or to defend from a melee attack, reduce its Accuracy by 2 (again to a minimum of 3). Recalibrating the weapon (a one-hour job) returns its Accuracy to normal.

The AM-47 is a large sniper rifle, primarily intended for the larger metahuman species. The rifle features a number of advanced electronics to assist the shooter in destroying their target. The AM-47 is provided with an imaging scope, smartgun system, underbarrel weight, bipod, and a safe target system with an extended barrel for increased range over the competition.

- I’m still amazed with the size of this rifle. I’ve seen trolls struggle with carrying it, and it’s longer than some elves are tall.
  - Beaker

- The extended barrel helps with the longer-range shots— and the shorter-ranged ones too.
  - Rock Pilot
