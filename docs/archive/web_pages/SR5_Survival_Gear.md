Originally called the “body bag,” the PED is a means to transport unconscious or immobile individuals that’s marketed to the general public as a lifesaving device. Essentially a flexible bag of woven Kevlar, the PED offers protection roughly equivalent to medium armors, and it is available in sizes to fit all metatypes. The PED can form an airtight seal and sufficient insulation to protect in hot, cold, or toxic environments; a tank with sufficient oxygen to survive an hour is optional. Emergency GPS beacons are standard.
