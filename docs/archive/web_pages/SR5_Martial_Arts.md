**LEARNING MARTIAL ARTS**

| DESCRIPTION | LEARNING TIME | KARMA | INSTRUCTION COST |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New Technique | 2 Weeks | 5 | 1,500¥ |
| New Style | 1 Month | 7 | 2,500¥ |
| Note:The learning of a new style comes with one technique available under that style. |

A person can be very good at dishing punishment out and taking a hit without any formal training. There’s no instructor needed to tell you to ball up your fist, or to swing your foot and connect with something vital; to duck as a sword is swinging toward your head, or run for cover when bullets are flying at you. Combat skills encompass the basics of close-combat actions and associated moves (Block, Charge, Dodge, Escape, Grapple, Parry, and Subdue), and the skill rating and specialization in a close-combat skill represents how well a character performs actions along with their general style of completing said action. Martial arts styles may also be selected as specializations for the normal cost of 7 Karma—selecting that specialization provides a +2 bonus when using that technique.

Each martial art style has six techniques for a character to choose (listed under Available Techniques). Buying a new style costs 7 Karma, and when you buy that style you may then choose a technique to go with it. Buying additional techniques costs 5 Karma. At character creation, you can buy up to 5 total techniques, in a single style, which costs 27 Karma. You can only buy one style at character creation.

After character creation, the character can continue to learn techniques within the martial art style or pick up a new martial art style. Each technique within the style takes 2 weeks to learn and the same Karma cost. A character can learn a new technique in a different martial art style, but they must spend the time to learn that style of fighting as well. Each new style takes 1 month to learn and costs 7 Karma for the style and the first technique; that time includes the learning of the technique. Once a style is known techniques within that style cost 5 Karma and 2 weeks to learn. A character can learn multiple styles, but there is a limit in how much stacking a character can get away with. You cannot gain more than a +2 bonus or a reduction in modifiers by more than 2 from purchasing the same technique from two different martial art styles.

## Magic And Martial Arts

### Touching, Grappling, Subduing, and Clinching with Touch Spells

When a character and opponent are in physical contact, such as when a magician is being subdued or subduing an opponent, and the magician is casting a spell directed at that opponent, the opponent can only resist the effects of the spell and does not get a Defense Test against the Touch Attack.

### Magical Martial Art Techniques

Some magicians may attempt to fight an opponent using a spell like Magic Fingers. This is a very challenging task with martial arts. This kind of combat doesn’t gain the benefits of the Superior Position modifier or Reach, nor does it gain an extra damage advantage, so some techniques do not apply. Visual modifiers apply as the use of the spell is based on line of sight. The gamemaster may apply additional modifiers for any action that requires finesse, such as using Dim Mak, if they feel it interferes with the spellcaster’s concentration on their magic.

### Physical Adept Powers With Techniques

| POWER | TECHNIQUE |
| --- | --- |
| Light Body | Rolling Cloud |
| Light Body | Leaping Mantis |
| Wall Running | Monkey Climb |

Some adept powers have a boost that is similar to a Martial Art technique, such as Rolling Cloud or Light Body. If the adept has both the power and the technique, the rules or bonuses of the power supersede the gains and rules of the technique. This means that the adept doesn’t gain benefit from both. If the adept turns off the power, however, she can still use and gain the advantage of the technique. Current list of powers/techniques with such an overlap include:

## Cybernetics and Martial Arts

With cybernetics, there are a few extra details that come up when mixing them with martial art styles and techniques. Here are a few that come up.

### Cybernetic Limbs And Hands

The Strength Rating of individual cybernetic limbs or partial cybernetics can be used on various techniques. When applying subduing damage to an opponent, the character could use their individual hand, arm, or leg Strength in the attempt, as various choke holds can be done either with the arm (example: halfnelson) or hand (example: trachea choke hold) or leg (triangular choke hold).

### Hand Razors, Blades, And Spurs

While these weapons work well in slicing up an opponent, they are not compatible with all actions and techniques. For example, when attempting to throw, grapple, subdue, or disarm an opponent, the character does not get the cyber weapon specialization bonus dice. Additionally, cybernetic weapons can be damaged and broken in combat. This is especially true in **[Sangre Y Acero](#Sangre_Y_Acero)** style of combat. Because the attack using a cybernetic melee weapon is based on the Physical Limit of the character, it doesn’t make sense to reduce the Accuracy of the weapon (that would be a Called Shot to a location). Instead, a successful Called Shot reduces the AP value by 1. If a cybernetic weapon is damaged more than once this way, it can no longer retract properly (if said cyber weapon was retractable). Damage to cyber weapons can only be repaired by a cybernetic specialist at one tenth the price of the cyberware being repaired and require a Logic + Cybertechnology [Mental] (10, 1 hour) Extended Test to complete.

### Skillwires

While skillwires help with the applicable skill rating for a character, they cannot allow the use of martial arts techniques without the character first learning the style and techniques separately.

## Multiple Attacks and Martial Arts

The Multiple Attack Free Action cannot be used with any technique that requires its own action (e.g., Counterstrike, Iaijutsu, Flying Kick, Throw Person). It can still be used with other techniques to reduce modifiers prior to the attack or increase the damage of the attack. It can also be used with certain Called Shot techniques (e.g., Pin, Entanglement). There is a specific martial art technique, Multiple Opponent Combat, that is specifically designed to be used with Multiple Attack Free Action.

## Spirits And Martial Arts

Fighting spirits has become somewhat more familiar in the Sixth World, but it still presents plenty of challenges. Techniques like Dim Mak or knocking down a spirit can be ineffective thanks to the wide anatomical variety spirits display when they materialize. Attempting to suffocate a spirit is impossible, as while they may assume physical forms, they don’t actually breathe. And their Immunity Power puts a damper on a lot of styles. No single martial art style deals directly with fighting spirits, but there is a technique for fighting such unusual opponents. The technique is called Neijia, and any character who has purchased a martial art style can learn this technique

### Neijia

Complex Action

Neijia means internal strength. It’s as close as a mundane can get to magical weaponry in fighting spirits. The technique focuses the spiritual and mental strength of the character in order to inflict damage to a Materialized spirit as an Attack of Will. It allows the character to perform a physical version of Astral Combat (p. 315, SR5) against Materialized spirits. The style of the attack is based on Tai Chi’s soft and fluid motion and mental discipline. The character must first make a successful Touch Attack against the spirit. This can include a Grapple or Clinch, but it also counts if the character has been Engulfed. Using only Willpower vs. Willpower as an attack, the character can impose Charisma + net hits in Stun Damage that the spirit must resist. This damage is not physical, so it cannot be used to take down wards or magical barriers. The character feels drained after making this attack, resisting Stun Damage equal to hits (not net hits) from the spirit defending against the attack. If they are a mage they resist Drain per their tradition; everyone else uses Willpower + Charisma.

## Electricity Damage And Martial Arts

Some weapons seem to be perfectly suited to particular martial arts. Like shock gloves and karate, or a stun baton and baritsu. Notice a common theme? Weapons that deal electricity damage give extra options when using Martial Arts. When a character with a Martial Art training attacks an opponent using a weapon such as a shock glove or stun baton, they have a choice of damage to apply. They can either opt for the normal, non-electric damage of the attack, taking full advantage of any Martial Arts techniques they use, or they can apply the shock damage without the net hits or increases from techniques. If the character is in touch contact with an opponent from a Grapple or Clinch and has equipment that deals electricity damage, the character may make a Free Action to initiate shock damage to the opponent provided that the gamemaster agrees that the weapon is also in touch contact with the opponent. If the weapon is not in touch contact, it costs the character a Simple Action. The target can attempt to squirm away, but the Grapple or Clinch means they have trouble moving, giving them a –3 dice penalty on their Defense Test. As is the case with TouchOnly Attacks (p. 187, SR5), the attack succeeds on a tied roll. As is the case above, neither net hits nor techniques will increase the Damage Value of the weapon when used in this fashion.

# Styles

**THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI**

| The way of the samurai is not a game; it’s a way of life and a way of thinking. It stresses frugality, loyalty, martial arts, and honor until death. The samurai trace their origins to medieval Japan. They became a cultural class after the emperor disbanded his army, leaving no one to protect the people. In response, the clans created the samurai to protect themselves and their own. They developed a code, similar to the ideals in chivalry in Europe, that governed how they protected and treated others. This way lasted for several hundred years and even became the basis of several laws. By the nineteenth century the samurai as a way of life declined as the government changed and social reforms abolished the samurai class for more modern concepts. During the twenty-first century, corporations gained power becoming independent of government. The poor got poorer, the rich got richer. This brought on the old need of people building protections for themselves, and the samurai was reborn. Concepts of loyalty, martial arts, and honor until death still ring true with today’s samurai. Frugality, however, was replaced with survival to meet with events of today. |

Each style can be used as a skill specialization. Some of these styles can be a specialization for a combination of skills. The gamemaster determines if it is allowable for that skill.

Examples
:   Chakram Fighting can be applied to both the Exotic Ranged and Melee Weapon skill
:   Gun Kata can be applied to both firearms and clubs

## Gymnastics

### Parkour

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Kip-up, Leaping Mantis, Monkey Climb, Rolling Cloud, Shadow Block

While not combat related, this style has to be mentioned as a collection of gymnastic techniques to move a character quickly and effectively around in any terrain. It originated as military obstacle training and has progressed into an urban style of travel. Since the 1980s, Parkour been used in dense urban environments for those who couldn’t afford their own transportation. Various gangs like the Spiders in Seattle actively train their members in Parkour.

## Unarmed Combat

### 52 Blocks

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Disarm), Kick Attack, Multiple Opponent Defense (Defender has Defended), Pouncing Dragon, Randori (Dirty Trick), Rooted Tree

Those that have spent any time in prison may have heard of the 52 Blocks. It’s a mixed martial art style of unarmed strikes and blocks within a confined space and possibly handcuffed. The intent of 52 Blocks is self-defense and survival. The moves are quick and dirty, designed for effect and effectiveness, not finesse. It’s not a style that is taught, especially outside prison and is usually learned the hard way.

### Aikido

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Disarm), Constrictor’s Crush, Counterstrike, Throw Person, Yielding Force (Counter Strike, Throw)

Aikido is similar to Jujutsu in that it primarily involves using Yielding Force; that is, using the opponent’s force and momentum against him. This requires the character trained in Aikido to use little effort in defending and attacking his opponent. Aikido is taught by many masters in dojos in Kyoto and Neo-Tokyo, and they require their students to study Japanese philosophy in addition to their martial art techniques. Variations, such as the French Kinomichi, can be found outside Japan.

### Bartitsu

Available Techniques
:   Ballestra, Bending of the Reed, Called Shot (Disarm), Kick Attack, Riposte, Sweep

Bartitsu is the gentleman’s martial art style. Its most famous practitioners—including Sherlock Holmes and John Steed—may be fictional, but it is a real martial art that trains people how to use walking sticks or umbrellas, items that the everyday person might carry, as a weapon. This martial art has continued to exist through self-defense classes throughout Europe and for those of the upper crust. A similar combat variation to Bartitsu is Bataireacht from Tír na nÓg, which focuses on the use of a cudgel or shillelagh.

### Boxing

**BOXING**

| This is what it’s always been—the simple sport of two men punching each other in the face till one falls down. In ancient history this was a matter of survival if the person couldn’t find a rock or stick. It wasn’t until the time of the Greeks and Romans that it would become a spectator sport and introduced into the Olympics. At that point, rules were defined and people started getting into various styles of boxing as a martial art. Boxing remains a popular international sport in the Sixth World with three separate federations each offering titles in eleven weightbased classes. Different boxers have different styles, which can generally be divided into the three styles displayed here: Brawler, Classic, and Swarmer. |

#### Boxing (Brawler Style)

Available Techniques
:   Clinch, Full Offense, Haymaker, Opposing Force (Block), Stagger, Thunder Strike

Using less finesse and footwork than Classic boxing, the Brawler style focuses on force and attempting to knock out the opponent before they can get in a damaging blow. You see the Brawler boxing style more often in street fighting than you do in the ring. Similar styles include Musti-yuddha from India, a boxing style that includes head butts, finger strikes, and no one who is faint of heart.

#### Boxing (Classic Style)

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Called Shot (Feint), Haymaker, Oaken Stance (Defense Against Being Knocked Down), Opposing Force (Block), Silken Storm

This is the style of professional boxing with faster, longer jabs and punches, relying on reach and footwork to get out of the way of the opponent’s incoming blows. While punching another person in the face has been around since the dawn of time, this style of combat is based on 18th century rules of combat. This would include opponents fighting upright, not purposely hitting below the belt, and no biting a person’s ear off (Usually). Dornálaíocht, an Irish style of boxing, is close to the Classic style of boxing, while bare-knuckled boxing relies more on blocks than dodges.

#### Boxing (Swarmer Style)

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Called Shot (Feint), Clinch, Haymaker, Silken Storm, Two-Headed Snake

The Swarmer style consists of using a flurry of blows, moving inside the reach of the opponent, and keeping mobile to dodge the opponent’s punches. This style has some of the same finesse as the Classic style, but it is fast and furious, both with constant movement and quicker punches.

### Capoeira

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Called Shot (Feint), Kick Attack, Kip-up, Sweep, Tricking

Brazilian style martial arts that include elbow slams, leg strikes, and head butts. It originated with African slaves in Brazil, and its moves were disguised as a fast-moving dance. Because practitioner’s hands were manacled, offensive maneuvers focused on kicks and sweeps. Capoeira was taught secretly in societies called quilombos. During the 1900s there was attempted prohibition on quilombos and those who practice it. The practice went underground for a while until the 1940s, when it was legalized.

### Carromeleg

Available Techniques
:   Counterstrike, Iaijutsu, Imposing Stone, Riposte, Shadow Block, Stagger

Some believe that this martial art dates back further than any other—as far back as what is theorized to be the Fourth World, when elves previously lived among humans. This art is a concentration of will and energy. There is no outward stance of someone ready to employ Carromeleg. It is the silence before the explosion as the practitioner of Carromeleg waits till the last moment before striking or counterstriking the opponent. When two masters meet, it is sometime anticlimactic as they size up their outward stance; what follows is a silent battle of will, which ends when one bows, ending the contest. It is only taught to elves and it is fiercely guarded by masters who want to keep it as an elven tradition. Bounties have been placed on those who attempt to teach this martial art to outsiders.

### Drunken Boxing

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Disarm, Feint), Defiant Dance, Full Offense, Karmic Response, Two-Headed Snake

Drunken Boxing, or Zui quan, is a style that replicates the movements of someone who is drunk. Movements within this style are about making combat unpredictable for an opponent. While looking unbalanced, a master of drunken boxing is skilled in balance and acrobatics. Though the technique does not need the practitioner to consume alcohol and literally become a drunken boxer, some take it too literally. Drunken Boxing teachings were banned in several NANs due to the behavior it caused.

### Jeet Kune Do

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Counter Strike, Kick, Opposing Force (Block), Randori (Vitals), Yielding Force (Counter Strike)

Jeet Kune Do is a martial art style developed by the master martial artist Bruce Lee. While it wasn’t fully defined before his death, it continued to progress based on his original teachings. Jeet Kune Do is sometimes practiced by adepts with a belief that their mentor spirit is Master Lee himself. Jeet Kune Do emphasizes counter strikes and the intercepting fist.

### Jujitsu

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Disarm), Chin Na, Clinch, Sacrificial Throw, Sweep, Throw Person

Also known as the Yielding Way, this is a style in which the practitioner uses the force of the opponent against them. It originated in the sixteenth century in Japan where unarmed strikes were ineffective against armored opponents. This martial art uses little or no weapons to defeat even an armed opponent. It focuses on subduing, throws, and disarming an opponent. Descendant styles of Jutitsu include Judo and Shooto, and techniques have been adopted by Aikido, Baritsu, and Brazillian Jujitsu.

### Karate

Available Techniques
:   Counter Strike, Kick, Kip-up, Opposing Force (Block), Sweep, Yielding Force (Counter Strike)

Karate is full-contact striking combat with over seven hundred years of use, and through all those years there were various kata or models of karate created. Only a dozen or so are accepted in tournaments and sporting events. Similar styles include Hwarang-do, Wushu, and Zen Do Kai. All three emphasize kicking, grappling, and striking. More advanced practitioners learn the use of weapons along with foot and fist.

### Knight Errant Tactical

Available Techniques
:   Barbed Hooks, Broken Fang, Called Shot (Break Weapon), Close Quarter Defense Against Firearms, Hammer Fist, Imposing Stone

Knight Errant Tactical training is high-threat response that emphasizes the ability to neutralize the opponent as a threat. One part of their training has been to disable the opponent’s weapon, either through bricking or by force. Such techniques have been coveted by other security forces in beefing up their own training course.

### Krav Maga

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Disarm), Clinch, Constrictor’s Crush, Imposing Stone, Releasing Talons, Ti Khao

This martial art style was developed in Israel for the defense forces. It’s a brutal mix of Muay Thai, boxing, and wrestling. Krav Maga emphasizes threat neutralization and has been adopted by Middle Eastern police and security forces. Other comparative training styles include ROSS, SAMBO, and MCMAP, which also adopted the same techniques. CAS and UCAS training have to stay competitive with other nations, so with MCMAP, they encourage soldiers to train in an additional martial art style such as Karate or Jujitsu.

### Lone Star Tactical

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Break Weapon), Close Quarter Defense Against Firearms, Herding, Multi ple Opponent Defense (Defender Has Defended Against Previous Attacks), Oaken Stance (Defense Against Being Charged), Rooted Tree

Lone Star Tactical training revolves around crowd control and combat in groups engaging multiple opponents. They also understand the importance of disabling an opponent’s weapon, while knowing that bricking firearms is a higher priority than making people drop a sword or stick.

### Muay Thai

Available Techniques
:   Clinch, Crushing Jaws, Finishing Move, Kick, Thunderstrike, Ti Khao

Often referred as Thai Boxing, Muay Thai is a professional sporting style emphasizing swift and brutal strikes with legs, knees, and elbows. It’s been part of Thailand’s military training regime and has become a popular sporting event on the trid. Since the early 2030s it has perennially been one of the top five most watched national sporting events alongside longtime favorites like boxing and newer hip sports such as urban brawl.

### Ninjutsu

Available Techniques
:   Counter Strike, Dim Mak, Flying Kick, Kick Attack, Randori (Dirty Trick), Tricking

Ninjutsu is the art of unconventional and guerrilla warfare from Japan. It’s also known as the way of the Ninja. There are eighteen different disciplines within ninjitsu focusing on sword combat, staff fighting, unarmed combat, and even pyrotechnical techniques. The Ninjutsu style presented focuses on close-combat skills.

### Okichitaw

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Pin), Counter Strike, Hard Technique (Parry), Randori (Vitals), Shadow Block, Sweep

This combat style was based on the Cree style of combat blended with Judo and Tae Kwon Do. For the NAN, it became basic training for the military. For the Sioux, it’s mandated as part of the required year of service before advancing to Wildcat training. The main weapons used with this martial art are the Gunstock War club and long knife; the styles also cover unarmed combat techniques based on hand positions with these weapons. Other weapons learned with Okichitaw are the tomahawk and plains dagger.

### Sangre Y Acero

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Break Weapon), Clinch, Crushing Jaws, Finishing Move, Pouncing Dragon, Tricking

Also known as Eztlitzli and Ars Cybernetica, this is a brutal style of cybernetic combat that originated in the darker corners of Tenochititlan. In the gladiator pits, fighters sport new and deadly cybernetic weapons to surprise their opponents. Anyone who thinks that they can fight in those pits without augmentations quickly find themselves as barghest chow the next day. This style is only practiced in Aztlan, and it has two types of practitioners: those that have survived and live in sponsored luxury and those that are dead.

A few other NAN special forces have their version of Wildcat style, but most prefer alternatives like Krav Maga. Some Amerind gangs with ex-Wildcats practice the Wildcat style of combat, with the vets passing their knowledge on to their gang members.

## Blades

**SWORD FIGHTING**

| Street samurai love their swords, but the classic weapon of street sammies is the katana. In fact, sales of katana-design swords have exceeded all other sword sales over the past fifty years thanks to all of the street samurai wannabes out there. Still, there are other martial art styles of sword fighting that are used today around the world that don’t use a katana. In Europe, there are three styles of swordplay to choose from: Fiore dei Liberi’s two-weapon sword fighting, Kunst des Fechtens’s longsword fighting style, and La Verdadera Destreza, which uses a rapier and is the progenitor of modern fencing. Competition with Kenjutsu’s style of fighting with a katana includes the Wudan Sword style using the Jian, or double-edged. straight sword. |

### Fiore Dei Liberi (Two Weapon Sword Fighting)

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Break Weapon), Opposing Force (Parry), Riposte, Two-Weapon-Style Attack, Two-Weapon-Style Defense, Yielding Force (Riposte)

The great Italian fighter of the fourteenth century, Fiore dei Liberi was both a mercenary and a fencing master. Toward the end of his fighting career, he published a martial arts manual of his various fighting techniques. One of the emphases with this style was that of the sword and dagger techniques. His preferred weapon was the longsword, which places this weapon style between Kunst des Fechten and Destreza.

### Kenjutsu

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Finishing Move, Iaijutsu, Multiple Opponent Combat, Multiple Opponent Defense (Friends in Melee), Opposing Force (Parry)

Kenjutsu is the all-encompassing term for the various Japanese schools of swordsmanship. Most commonly kenjutsu was fought with wooden swords (Bokken) and as an art rather than combat. With the reintroduction of the samurai as a way of life, Kenjutsu and Nitojutsu styles of combat using the iconic katana also returned.

### Kunst Des Fechtens (Longsword Fighting)

Available Techniques
:   Half-Sword, Multiple Opponent Combat, Opposing Force (Parry), Pouncing Dragon, Riposte, Yielding Force (Riposte)

German for the Art of Fencing, this line of teaching covers the use of a longsword and two-handed blades. Kunst des Fechtens is about slashing strokes rather than thrusts. Like the Wudang Sword, Kunst des Fechtens swordplay revolves around five major movements and twelve minor movements, all focused on timing and stance. This style is more aggressive, using leverage and brute strength to take down an opponent.

### La Verdadera Destreza (Rapier Fighting)

Available Techniques
:   Ballestra, Multiple Opponent Combat, Multiple Opponent Defense, Opposing Force (Parry), Riposte, Yielding Force (Riposte)

This Spanish swordsmanship was compiled in the sixteenth century, separating itself from other European styles with the emphasis on circular movements with a sword and relying on thrusts and ripostes with a rapier. The modern fencing sport descends from the Destreza style of swordplay. Masters of the art, Camillo, Agrippa, and Thibault, have all lent their names to specific defensive and offensive strategies with the sword. Most of the trid star combat with swords is tied to this technique, as it has the most flourish and flash.

### Pentjak-silat

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Break Weapon, Disarm), Dim Mak, Jiao Di (Charge), Randori (Vitals), Silken Storm

An ancient martial art from Indonesia that is over a thousand years old, Pentjak-Silat is actually an umbrella term for several techniques. It teaches the use of several weapons such as the kris and focuses on striking vital points of the opponent. It is predominantly practiced in Indonesia. Adepts have discovered that this style is effective and potent when used with weapon foci.

### Wudang Sword

Available Techniques
:   Ballestra, Finishing Move, Flying Kick, HammerFist, Iaijutsu, Riposte

Wudang Sword is part of the greater wudang martial arts tradition. This style has been passed down for hundreds of years and coveted as one of the greatest sword styles from China. Many variations of sword techniques in other Chinese martial arts derive themselves from Wudang sword, but none surpass it. It consists of one sword with six sections and 132 movements. The style is beautiful with graceful lunges and jumps. Wudang Dui Jian is the dance that occurs when two Wudang sword masters meet.

## Clubs

Arnis De Mano is a two-weapon fighting style that typically uses two rattan sticks, but it can also involve two daggers, or a stick and a dagger. It is less formal than the Fiore dei Liberi style, and often focuses on learning how to fight prone or using what’s available to your advantage. Arnis De Mano, Escrima, and Kali styles are from the same family of Philippine martial arts.

### Jogo Du Pau

Available Techniques
:   Barbed Hooks, Herding, Oaken Stance (Defense Against Being Charged, Defense Against Being Knocked Down), Opposing Force (Parry), Pouncing Dragon

This Portuguese martial art style revolves around the use of a staff. It is said to have begun with the versatility of the staff as a tool in climbing rural terrain, crossing rivers, and defense against wild animals. While it’s been in decline since the 20th century as people moved to cities, it has made a bit of a comeback for people who want something to fall back on when a gun or knife isn’t available.

### Quarterstaff Fighting

Available Techniques
:   Jiao Di (Knock Down), Multiple Opponent Combat, Opposing Force (Parry), Sweep, Stagger, Thunderstrike

Quarterstaff combat differs from Baritsu in that it uses a longer weapon and the style allows for multiple strikes by holding the weapon in the center. Quarterstaff fighting is traditionally European, but similar styles include Bojutsu and Gun. It’s all about keeping the staff in front of you and moving to shield you from blows while looking for the opportunity to get a strike in. A modern version of this style using the vibranox staff is based on a fictional trid called Denn’Bok.

## Archery

### Kyujutsu

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Pin), Close Quarter Firearms (Archery), Hammer Fist, Knucklebreaker (Blast Out of Hand), Soaring Shackles, Tricking

“The Art of Archery” as it is known, is one of the weapon techniques learned by samurai. This was the art that was used in battle in early Japan. By the late 16th century it declined due to the increased use of firearms. Kyujutsu survived as a practice along with the more formal Kyudu, the way of the bow, which emphasizes aesthetics rather than fighting. By the 21st century, Kyujutsu was revived once more with the return of the samurai as a way of life. Instead of the traditional yumi bow, practitioners took up more modern compound bows.

### Turkish Archery

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Pin), Close Quarters Defense Against Firearms, HammerFist, Silken Storm, Soaring Shackles, Thunder Strike

Turkish Archery has two unique combat actions: Jarmakee and Majra. Jarmakee is a balanced stance allowing the archer to shoot from behind the head to give a better angle without exposing herself to an opponent. Majara is overdrawing; using shorter arrows with an accompanying tool. The intent, as the story goes, is that the opponent then couldn’t use the arrows to fire back. There are few practitioners of Turkish Archery, with most people preferring firearms and smartlinks, but there are still tournaments held in Istanbul.

## Firearms

### Firefight

Available Techniques
:   Clinch, Close Quarter Defense Against Firearms, Close Quarter Firearms (Pistols), Multiple Opponent Defense (Friends in Melee), Oaken Stance (Defense Against Being Knocked Down, Defense Against Being Charged)

Firefight is a unique combat training style first developed by Ares in 2068 based on existing military combat training for urban terrain. It deals specifically with fighting in close quarters against both ranged and melee opponents. Those who practice Firefight learn how to use a firearm effectively while in melee combat. Originally only Ares FireWatch teams learned these proprietary techniques, but through espionage and shadowrunners, a few mercenary groups and security forces have learned similar training techniques.

### Gun Kata

Available Techniques
:   Close Quarter Firearms (Pistols), Kip-up, Multiple Opponent Defense (Friends in Melee), Opposing Force (Block), Tricking, Stagger

Also known as Gun Fu, this martial art style is what all the fan boys want to know how to do after watching the action trids. It’s also the style that leads to the most accidental shooting incidents and elbow injuries from people thinking it’s best to hold a gun sideways. The real form of the art, as opposed to the one seen in trids, has some similarities to Ares Firefight, but with more flourish and flair. Additionally, the gun is used as both a ranged and melee weapon. There are synergies between Firefight and Gun Kata, and often after learning one, the martial artist will continue with the other. Guns used with Gun Kata have to be custom designed for impact and tricked with melee accessories. Few armorers can do such work, which means that each piece is unique enough often to identify the artist. Gun Kata practitioners also modify their smartlink so as to not receive warning feedback for the improper handling of a firearm and useless targeting data that does not account for their unorthodox uses of their weapons.

### The Cowboy Way

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Entanglement), Hammer Fist, Haymaker, Knucklebreaker (Blast), Stagger, Tricking

The Cowboy Way, named after more iconic American practitioners, has its origins further back with the Huns, Tartars, and even Persians who used the lasso in hand to hand combat to ensnare opponents and to drag them off horses or out of formation to be killed. Today the technique includes a mix of gun fighting, rope use, and unarmed combat stylized by trids. It does not require wearing a ten-gallon hat, but some practitioners do anyway. Especially those with Distinctive Style.

## Exotic Weapons

### Chakram Fighting

Available Techniques
:   Called Shot (Pin), Close Quarter Firearms (Thrown Weapons), Knucklebreaker (Blast Out of Hands), Multiple Opponent Defense (Friends in Melee), Opposing Force (Block), Ti Khao

This martial art style originated in India in the Eighth century, with the use of the chakram, a circular weapon with a sharpened outside edge. Since then it has been copied in Mongolia, Tibet, Malaysia, and Indonesia with variations in the design of chakram. The chakram can be worn on the head, arm, or wrist to be used in melee combat or damage an opponent while clinching or subduing them. The chakram can also be thrown at ranged targets. The tanjani technique is where the chakram is spun around a finger, adding range and power before it is hurled at a target. In 2061 chakram bracelets became a fad for a while as both a weapon and fashion statement.

### Whip Fighting

Available Techniques
:   Bending of the Reed, Called Shot (Entanglement), Hammer Fist, Herding, Multiple Opponent Defense (Friends in Melee), Multiple Opponent Combat

Whip Fighting as a martial art style comes mainly from the Philippines. Latigo y Daga (Whip and Dagger) focuses on the use of flexible weapons; other martial art styles, such as caci and wushu, use weapons such as chain whips, but do not emphasize it as a primary weapon. Whip Fighting covers entanglement of an opponent and, like a lion tamer, herding multiple opponents with the crack of the whip.

# Techniques

These martial art techniques cover various new actions, Called Shots, and bonuses to actions that can be learned in a martial art style. These techniques can only be purchased through a martial art style or the **[One Trick Pony Quality](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Positive_Qualities#One_Trick_Pony "SR5:Positive Qualities")**. Note that characters should use each technique as appropriate to the martial art style even though the technique is available for various styles. For example, while the brawl style of boxing includes the Jiao Di technique, it should represent hook and jab combinations to knock down an opponent.

## Ballestra

Clubs or Blades Only

Complex Action

Requires Martial Arts

The character lunges forward with a long step toward his opponent, effectively adding +1 to the Reach of the attack. The character over commits himself in the maneuver, leaving himself vulnerable. The character takes a –1 to any Defense Tests and cannot use any Active Defense techniques until after his next Action Phase. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Barbed Hooks

Close Combat Only

Interception Interrupt Action
:   +1 Die

The character is quick to strike out at opponents as they move within his space. The technique provides a +1 die bonus to Interception Interrupt Action tests.

## Bending Of The Reed

There’s two ways to face an opponent’s attack: meet it head on or not be there. Bending of the Reed is the approach of avoiding an attack by being more flexible and using gymnastics to not be there when the strike occurs. This technique grants a +1 die bonus to Defense Tests when using the Dodge Interrupt Action.

## Broken Fang

Broken Fang is a set of strikes that specifically target various weapons in order to make them less effective when used. Even a slight bend in a sword can cause a strike to miss its mark. Reduce Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Break Weapon).

## Called Shots

Whenever a Called Shot is used as a technique it means one of two things. If the Called Shot is normally available to everyone, the character can reduce the Called Shot modifier by 1 for that Called Shot. If the Called Shot description includes an action that requires Martial Arts training, then the character is allowed to use that technique but gets no reduction in the Called Shot modifier.

### Called Shot (Break Weapon)

Close Combat Only

Gives access to the Break Weapon Called Shot

In close combat, a character might try to damage or break an opponent’s weapon with his own attack. The sword-breaker dagger is an example of a weapon designed specifically for this task. When the character makes an attack, the weapon resists as a barrier (p. 197, SR5). Most weapons including guns are considered heavy material on the Barrier Rating table (p. 197, SR5). If the attack is successful and does damage, the opponent’s weapon becomes damaged and is less effective. There are two options for a Break Weapon Called Shot. If the accuracy of the weapon is higher than 3, the character can reduce the accuracy of the weapon by 1. This can be done multiple times until the weapon has been reduced to an accuracy of 3. If the weapon has Reach greater than 0, the character can damage the weapon by reducing its Reach by 1. This can be done multiple times until Reach is 0. Note that use of this Called Shot requires Martial Art training.

### Called Shot (Disarm)

Close Combat Only

There’s always the chance that a character might make the mistake of bringing nothing to a gunfight. Or knife fight. Either way, it’s bad news, and one of the first things to do in this situation is even the odds—or even tilt them the other way by seizing the weapon.

With this Called Shot, the character makes an unarmed attack. If the attack is successful and the character’s Strength plus net hits exceeds the opponent’s Physical Limit, the character snatches the targeted weapon out of the opponent’s hands and can use it themselves, though they have to take a Ready Weapon Action to do so (it’s not likely that they snatched the weapon in such a way that it’s set properly in their hand).

If the attack is successful but the character’s Strength plus net hits do not exceed the opponent’s Physical limit, then the opponent receives a penalty equal to the net hits if they use that weapon during their next Action Phase. If the character fails in the attack, then the opponent has a +2 dice pool bonus in attacking the character with that weapon for that Action Phase. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

### Called Shot (Entanglement)

Specified Exotic Weapons Only

The character can use a rope or whip-like weapon to entangle her opponents instead of outright killing them. In an Armed Combat Attack using an Exotic Melee Weapon Skill, the character can use net hits from the attack to reduce the opponent’s Agility for that Action Phase instead of dealing damage from the weapon. If the attack generated any net hits at all, the opponent cannot move any further away from the character than the range of the weapon. If the opponent’s Agility is reduced to 0, the opponent can do no other action than attempt to break free. Like a subdual or clinch, the opponent will have to break free of the entanglement in order restore his agility attribute. If they want to get away, the opponent can attempt an Escape Artist + Agility [Physical] Test as a Complex Action with a threshold of the number of successes used to reduce his Agility. If successful, the opponent is free and no longer suffers from the Agility penalty. Weapons that can be used with this called shot include: chain whip, leather whip, manrike, kusarigama, rope dart, and lariat. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

### Called Shot (Feint)

Close Combat Only

With a Feint, a character can draw his opponent to make a bad move in their attack. The attack does no damage, but if it is successful, it fools the opponent and forces them to prepare to defend against the false attack. This means that in the next Action Phase, when the character truly attacks, the opponent takes a penalty to his Defense Test equal to the net hits of the Feint. An opponent cannot be penalized by more than one Feint action by the character before the character attacks; if the character attempts multiple Feints, only the net hits from the most recent Feint Action apply. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

### Called Shot (Pin)

Archery/Thrown Weapon only.

With an appropriate ranged weapon, the character can pin an opponent to the floor, the ground, or a wall. On a successful attack with the weapon, if the DV exceeds the Armor Rating of the target’s clothing (meaning augmentations like dermal plating would not be taken into account), then the flesh and clothing of the opponent are pinned to that object. Net hits determine how securely the opponent is pinned. While the opponent is pinned, he suffers a –2 penalty to all Defense Tests.

To break free of a pin, the character can make a Body + Strength [Physical] Test as a Simple Action with a threshold of the net hits of the pin. The character can also rip himself free as a Free Action, but takes 1 box of unresisted physical damage for each net hit on the Pin Called Shot. Both the Simple and Free Action can be attempted in the same Action Phase. If the Simple Action fails, the difference between the hits rolled and the threshold are added to the Physical Damage the character takes when attempting to break free. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Chin Na

Chin Na is the art of catching and locking joints. There are seventy-two specific techniques, including small joint manipulation. The proper pulling or bending of fingers, wrists, or toes gives a weaker character more leverage over a stronger opponent. Add +2 to the Physical Limit of the character for Subduing Actions.

## Clinch

A Clinch is a grappling position in a stand-up fight, where the opponent’s effective Reach has been neutralized. A Clinch is included in several martial arts and can be used as a medium to move from a stand-up fight to a ground fight through throws and knock down actions. With a successful opposed Gymnastics + Agility [Physical] vs. Reaction + Intuition Test, the character has clinched their opponent. This means that the character has a hold of the opponent (and possibly visa versa), so they can’t move away from each other. The difference between a Clinch and a Grapple action is that a Grapple involves a lock or choke hold on the opponent to immobilize him, while a Clinch doesn’t immobilize an opponent and allows both the character and opponent to make actions other than those involving the Clinch.

The character who initiated the Clinch gets the Superior Position bonus modifier to actions while maintaining control of the Clinch. Both the character and opponent’s Reach bonus are negated, and attacks with melee weapons receive a penalty equal to their Reach bonus. Firearm use by both the character and opponent are penalized by the net successes of the Clinch. Unless the opponent escapes from the Clinch, neither opponent nor character can move away from each other. They can, however, move up to 2 meters together on each of their actions. A character in the inferior position can attempt to use an Escape Action to break the Clinch. A character in the Superior Position can let go of the Clinch as a Free Action; at this point the character in an inferior position can choose to use an Interrupt Action (–5 Initiative Score) to attempt to maintain the Clinch and gain Superior Position. This requires a new Gymnastics + Agility [Physical] by the player in the inferior position, and they receive a +1 dice pool bonus thanks to the fact that they are already in contact with the other character; the character in the Superior Position does not get the Superior Position bonus in this instance.

A successful Clinch Action can lead to a Subdual, Called Shot: Knockdown, or Throw. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Close Quarter Firearms

(RANGED WEAPONS ONLY)

In the early use of ranged weapons when the enemy charged in with swords and axes, this sort of training helped keep the archer alive. Today this technique has been modified to be effective with firearms while in close-quarter combat with an opponent. This has been effective against being charged by an opponent or within a mixed amount of close combat and exchange of fire. Close Quarter Firearms is learned for a specific Ranged Weapon Skill. Reduce the ranged combat Attacker in Melee Combat modifier by 1 for the character when using Firearms, Bow, or Throwing Weapons Skill (Depending on the Martial Art style it’s tied to). This technique can be selected more than once to gain each skill.

## Close Quarter Defense Against Firearms

The Close Quarter Defense Against Firearms technique teaches the character to avoid getting shot while engaged in close combat. This includes keeping your melee opponent in the line of fire of other opponents and keeping mobile. This technique provides a +1 die bonus to Defense Tests against Ranged Attacks if engaged in close combat.

## Constrictor’s Crush

This technique masters various choke holds usually involving constricting air or blood flow to the head, to more quickly subdue a target. +1 DV when inflicting damage on a subdued opponent.

## Counterstrike

Counterstrike allows the character to leverage the opponent’s force into an advantage, allowing the character to make a quick strike back. In place of the standard Defense Test, the character makes an Unarmed Combat + Reaction [Physical] Test against the opponent’s standard Attack Test. If the defender achieves more hits than the attacker, the defender successfully avoided the attacker’s strike while returning and landing a strike of their own. The defender’s counterstrike attack has a Damage Value equal to the defending character’s standard Unarmed DV + net hits. The damage is resisted by a standard Damage Resistance Test. If the defender does not achieve more hits, then he must make a Damage Resistance Test against the damage of the attacker’s strike as normal.

## Crushing Jaws

The Crushing Jaws technique covers clinches and locks that bend bone and strain muscles. It covers maneuvers with names like can opener, bear hug, and Boston crab, moves that are illegal for many combat sports as they can cause serious injury or death. The Crushing Jaws technique allows Subduing actions (P. 195, SR5) to cause Physical Damage equal to the character’s Strength. This technique can only be used once per Combat Turn.

## Defiant Dance

This technique keeps the character flexible, helping them know how to turn a disadvantage to an advantage. When the character is attempting to reverse a Subdual hold on him, reduce the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Reversal) or reduce the threshold for the Reversal Interrupt Action by 1 (Player’s choice).

## Dim Mak

Also known as the touch of death, this technique takes advantage of artery and nerve points to cause lasting pain, making the targeted arm or leg ineffective. Reduce Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Specific Location). An arm or leg must be the location targeted.

## Fighting In The Dark

Martial art styles don’t specifically train someone to fight without sight, but there are special students who practice relying on their other senses to achieve success. To this end, they learn how to Strike the Darkness. Any character who has purchased a Martial Art style can learn this technique.

## Finishing Move

A finishing move is that way-cool trid final attack maneuver the hero makes to defeat the bad guy. The character must declare that he is performing a Finishing Move combination. The character makes an attack. If the character successfully damages an opponent with the melee attack, the character can then make an immediate extra strike against the same opponent with a +2 dice pool modifier. A gratuitous Free Action to taunt the opponent can also be applied, especially if the attacker is holding the target’s spine and skull in his hands at the time. This action can only be performed once per Combat Turn. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Flying Kick

Covering scissor, butterfly, crescent, hook, and reverse roundhouse kicks, this Action offers both range and power to the unarmed attack. The character must be at least a meter away from the opponent and be able to move toward the opponent to perform this action. A Flying Kick Action gives both +1 Reach and +1 dice pool bonus to the unarmed attack. If the Flying Kick Action is unsuccessful, the character becomes off balance, suffering a –1 dice pool penalty to Defense Tests until the character’s next Action Phase. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Full Offense

A Full Offense attack occurs when a character accepts that he’s going to get hurt and doesn’t care so long as he hurts his opponent more. This is also the usual state of drunken brawlers, though their accuracy tends to be diminished. The attacking character receives a +2 dice pool modifier to their Close Combat skill test, but may not use any Defensive Interrupt Actions for that Action Phase (Block, Dodge, Full Defense, Parry, etc.). They also adjust their Initiative Score by –5. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Grasping Vines

This technique improves the practice of using a whip, chain, or rope in quickly entangling an opponent. Reduce the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Entanglement) (Exotic Weapon only).

## Half Sword

Blades only

This odd technique involves grabbing the center part of the blade for a more forceful thrust against an armored target with the intent of piercing the target’s armor. Back in the days of plate armor, the Half Sword action was like using the sword as a crowbar and peeling back the armor. Today’s armor is more flexible, but the intent is the same. With a successful attack, the character improves their AP by 2 for the weapon. If the character fails, he takes a –2 penalty to his next action (not counting Defense Tests) and cannot use the Parry or Block Defensive Actions until his next Action Phase. Regardless of success or failure, the character has to Ready the Weapon (as he’s holding it in an unusual manner) in order to attack again. This move cannot be combined with Two Weapon fighting as it requires both hands. The weapon must be a blade with at least a Reach of 1. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Hammerfist

This technique adapts some of the geometric tricks of shooting pool in determining the angle of attack. The technique teaches the attacker to maximize the force against the weakest part of an opponent’s grip on the object to be successful in knocking it out of the opponent’s hand. Reduce the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Blast Out of Hands).

## Haymaker

(CLOSE COMBAT ONLY)

While the Pouncing Dragon technique has the character using gravity to his advantage, not every combat allows the character to have superior position. With the Haymaker, the character uses centrifugal force in order gain power in the attack. This action is wild and obvious to an opponent. With this attack, the character gives the opponent +2 to their Defense Test. If successful the character gets +1 DV.

## Herding

As if engaging in some sort of masochistic dance, the character can use attacks and feints to maneuver an opponent into a bad position, such as on top of a land mine or against an open elevator shaft. On a successful Close Combat Attack, the character deals no damage to his opponent. Instead, the character can move the opponent 1 meter per net hit in the direction of the character’s choosing, up to the Walking rate of the character or opponent, whichever is less. A character may attempt herding multiple opponents by splitting his dice pool as normal (Multiple Attacks, p. 196, SR5). The distance that the character can herd multiple opponents is determined on an individual opponent basis.

## Iaijutsu

Iaijutsu is the art of sword drawing, though this technique goes beyond just using a sword. With this action, the character may perform Quick Draw Simple Action (p. 165, SR5) with any melee weapon. As with the quick draw rules, the weapon must be properly sheathed or holstered in order to use the Quick Draw Action. If successful, the character can then attack with the weapon as a Simple Action instead of a Complex Action for that Action Phase.

## Imposing Stone

This technique is used when intercepting an opponent trying to move past the character. The character places himself in a position in which the opponent cannot progress past him. Add 2 to the character’s Damage Value when calculating if the opponent has been stopped by the character’s attack. This bonus is not added to the actual Damage Value against the opponent—it is only used to determine stopping power.

## Jiao Di

Jiao Di, or “Horn Butting,” was supposedly used in China to gore enemies of the emperor. The technique allows the character to do more damage when making a charge attack. Using it provides +1 DV on the Charge Action or reduces the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Knock Down). Characters only receive one of these benefits, as listed with the martial art style they select. If they want access to the other bonus, they must select this technique again.

## Karmic Response

What goes around, comes around. With this technique, the character has practiced not only breaking out of a subduing or clinch attack, but doing it in such a way as to reverse the hold. With this technique, a character may perform a Reversal Action (Either Called Shot or Interrupt) instead of an Escape Action.

## Kick Attack

Yeah, everyone can insert boot in opponent’s groin, but not everyone can level a kick to the sternum or raise their leg above their head and drop it like an axe without pulling something. From the traditional back, side, and reverse kicks to the axe kick, this is a staple of many martial arts. This technique provides +1 Reach to basic Unarmed Combat Actions. Multiple purchases of this technique cannot be combined to give more than a +1 Reach advantage.

## Kip-up

From a Prone position, the character can kick himself back into a standing position and perform an immediate Close Combat Attack Action against a nearby target. The character must make an Agility + Gymnastics [Physical] (3) Test. If successful, the character can then make a Close Combat Attack as a Simple Action. The character can’t move from a Kip-up to attack an opponent if they are not in Reach. Failure on a Kip-up Action means that the character is still Prone.

## Knucklebreaker

(CLOSE COMBAT ONLY)
This technique targets the bones and joints of the fingers on an opponent when removing an object from his hand. He may choose to inflict damage as if it was a normal melee attack when making a Called Shot (Disarm) or Called Shot (Blast Out of Hands). The player selects which of those two Called Shots this technique applies to when they select it; if they want to use it for both techniques, they need to select it again. Damage from a Knucklebreaker is Stun only.

## Leaping Mantis

This technique pushes the body to the limit in jumping long distances. The character stretches his body out to get the extra distance across a chasm. The end result is the character is Prone, either hanging on to the other edge, or flat out on the other side. The character’s maximum horizontal jump distance goes from Agility x 1.5 meters to Agility x 2 meters.

## Monkey Climb

This technique lets runners use leverage on various obstacles and wall corners to quickly climb over short walls. Usually the character runs at the wall to gain momentum and then uses that energy to their advantage. For any wall of a height of 5 meters or less, this technique allows the character to climb unassisted at the assisted climbing speed of 1 meter per hit.

## Multiple Opponent Combat

Some characters are used to fighting multiple opponents at the same time—or at least pissing off multiple people at the same time, who then want to hurt him. This technique is a specific freestyle of attacking and defending against multiple opponents in quick succession without knowing who will attack first. Bouncers, for example, might have become accustomed to dealing with a drunk’s buddies when showing the drunk to the door and not knowing which hothead was going to take the first swing. When a character decides to attack multiple opponents (Multiple Attack Free Action, p. 196, SR5) with each split directed to a different opponent. Characters can add 1 to the total dice pool if fighting two to three opponents, or add 2 to the total dice pool for four or more opponents. This addition is made to the total pool before it is split for each of the attacks.

## Multiple Opponent Defense

Sometimes you’re banging multiple heads together, other times you have a group of thugs all intent on crushing your skull. In the latter case, use Multiple Opponent Defense to give you a shot at keeping your skull in its proper three-dimensional shape. If you have this and are being attacked in melee combat by multiple assailants, reduce Friends in Melee modifier for the attackers by 1 or reduce the Defender has Defended Against Previous Attacks penalty by 1 (Meaning that the –1 die penalty starts on the third attack). Characters can use only one of these options, as noted in their particular martial arts style.

## Oaken Stance

This technique is practiced in various styles of wrestling; it’s known as the Horse stance in martial arts. It allows the character better control of their center of balance to prevent being knocked down or charged in close combat. Add +1 die to the Melee Defense Tests of the character when an opponent is attempting to use Called Shot (Knock Down) against her or +1 die in Melee Defense Tests when receiving a Charge with a Delayed Action. Characters only receive one of these benefits, as listed with the martial art style they select.

## Opposing Force

Opposing Force is the practice of meeting force with force. Various martial arts both in Asia and Europe have this technique in the practice of blocks and parries. It can also be termed as the Strong or Hard technique. Practitioners of this technique get +1 die to Block or +1 die to Parry. Characters only receive one of these benefits, as listed with the martial art style they select.

## Pouncing Dragon

Close Combat Only

Pouncing Dragon is a close-combat attack where the character has superior position to the opponent and uses gravity to their advantage. This move can be made from a position standing above the opponent, the opponent being prone or standing below the character, or it can be executed when the character is in a Clinch with the opponent, both of them are on the ground, and the character’s Superior Position advantage is that they are on top of the opponent. Typically learned through mixed martial arts, various wrestling arts, or weapon martial arts as a way to dispatch fallen opponents, Pouncing Dragon requires characters to take advantage of gravity and put their weight behind the attack. Besides the Superior Position modifier, the character gets +2 DV on a successful attack. After the attack, the character is at the same level as the opponent and loses the Superior Position advantage.

## Releasing Talons

This technique is about the character taking the opponent’s weapon as smoothly as possible. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Disarm).

## Randori

This is a freestyle technique of sparring by using any means necessary. While variations are incorporated into martial arts such as Judo and Aikido, the generic technique includes eye gouging and other less than friendly holds and attacks. Reduce Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Dirty Trick), reduce the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Vitals), or reduce the Called Shot penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Specific Location (Eye)). Characters only receive one of these benefits, as listed with the martial art style they select.

## Riposte

Riposte allows shadowrunners to leverage an opponent’s force to their advantage, giving a character the chance to make a quick strike back at an attacker with their readied weapon. In place of the standard Defense Test, the character makes a (Melee Weapon Skill) + Reaction [Accuracy] Test against the opponent’s standard Attack Test. If the defender achieves more net hits than the attacker, the defender successfully avoided the attacker’s strike and managed to return a strike of their own. The defender’s riposte attack has a Damage Value equal to the normal DV of the weapon + net hits and is resisted by a standard Damage Resistance Test. If the defender does not achieve more hits, then he must make a Damage Resistance Test against the damage of the attacker’s strike, with the damage increased by 2 due to the defender being off balance after their failed riposte.

## Rolling Clouds

This technique is about adjusting the kinetic energies thrust upon a body so that it bends and doesn’t break. This includes resisting injuries from falling/jumping from heights or from being thrown. It reduces the DV of Falling Damage by 1.

## Rooted Tree

Rooted Tree allows a character to quickly shift their center of gravity and resist an attack attempting to move them without leaving their spot. It provides +1 to the Physical limit when resisting the Push, Shove, or Sacrificial Move actions.

## Sacrifice Throw

A throw normally keeps the character standing, using their hip, leg, or shoulder to leverage the opponent into being thrown. The Sacrifice Throw technique uses the whole character’s body as counterweight for the throw. At the end both the character and opponent are Prone. Add the character’s Strength and Body to the net hits of the unarmed attack to determine if it exceeds the opponent’s Physical Limit. If successful, the opponent can then be thrown up to a number of meters equal to 1 plus the net hits scored on the test. The maximum distance that a character can throw an opponent is the difference in the character’s Strength minus the opponent’s Body in meters. If this distance value is less than 0, then the maximum distance is 0, meaning less than one meter away from the character. The opponent suffers damage equal to the net successes of the test, not the distance thrown. If the initial test is successful but the throwing character did not exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit, then both characters are on the ground with no damage done to either. If the attack is unsuccessful, the throwing character is Prone and takes damage equal to the number of net hits scored by the opponent minus the throwing character’s Physical Limit. This may be no damage if the character succeeded in the attack, but did not exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit.

## Shadow Block

to the net successes of the test, not the distance thrown. If the initial test is successful but the throwing character did not exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit, then both characters are on the ground with no damage done to either. If the attack is unsuccessful, the throwing character is Prone and takes damage equal to the number of net hits scored by the opponent minus the throwing character’s Physical Limit. This may be no damage if the character succeeded in the attack, but did not exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit.

Shadow Block can also be used to counteract an Evade action. As above, the character with Shadow Block makes a Gymnastics + Agility [Physical] Test with the threshold being the opponent’s net hits from their Evade Test. If successful they reduce this net hits on the test, thereby reducing the number of people the person attempting the Evade automatically passes. The Shadow Blocker can choose which person then can attack, but it has to be someone who was within five meters of the person attempting to Evade at some point in their movement.

## Silken Storm

The Silken Storm technique is a series of finesse strikes to the body, aimed at spots that will break or bruise painfully. It can be done with bare hands, with a club, or with the use of both the edge and flat of a blade. This technique reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Splitting the Damage).

## Soaring Shackles

This technique focuses the character on the opponent’s motions, looking for the intersection of projectile, barrier, and opponent. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Pin).

## Stagger

This technique focuses attacks on sensory and nerve areas to disorient an opponent. This technique covers the ear slap, or a strike to the groin, solar plexus, or throat. It’s not the prettiest of attacks, but shadowrunning isn’t about appearances. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Shake up) or Called Shot (Specific Location (Eye, Ear, Sternum)).

### Strike The Darkness

Blind Fighting
:   -1 Penalty

This technique reduces the character’s reliance on his sight to fight an opponent. It’s a mix of using other senses such as hearing and smell and using memory, remembering previous blocks and strikes to predict the opponent’s next position. It reduces the penalty for Blind Fighting by 1.

## Sweep

(CLOSE COMBAT ONLY)

Martial Art techniques allow more control over how the opponent falls when the character knocks him off his feet (Knockdown, p. 194, SR5). He may choose to inflict damage as if it were a normal melee attack. Damage type from a sweep is always Stun.

## Throw Person

Simple Action

Requires Martial Arts

If the character has successfully engaged in a Clinch or Subduing action against an opponent, he may then attempt to throw their opponent. Throw person can also be done as an Interrupt Action (–10 from Initiative Score) after successfully blocking an opponent’s attack. A throw is done using the leverage of the opponent’s body and/or force of action into projecting the opponent to the ground. The character rolls an Unarmed Combat Attack Test, opposed as normal. If the character succeeds and character’s Strength + net hits exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit, the opponent can then be thrown up to a number of meters equal to the net hits scored on the test. The maximum distance that a character can throw an opponent is the difference in the character’s Strength minus the opponent’s Body in meters. If this distance value is less than 0, then the maximum distance is 0, meaning less than one meter away from the character. The opponent suffers damage equal to the net successes of the test, not the distance thrown. At the end of the throw, the opponent is Prone. The opponent could suffer additional damage at the location where he is thrown, such as a fire pit or into the mouth of a sarlacc. If the character is successful in the attack but does not exceed the opponent’s Physical Limit, the opponent is not thrown and is still standing but remains in a Clinch or Subduing grip. Failure means the target is not thrown and also escapes the character’s grip. Note that use of this action requires Martial Art training.

## Thunder Strike

Thunder strike is a fierce punch or strike with a weapon. It’s not just a punch to the nose; it’s an upper cut to the nose that makes your opponent even uglier. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Harder Knock).

## Ti Khao

From Muay Thai, this technique covers various knee strikes that the character can do while in a Clinch with an opponent. When in Clinch combat, the character can leverage their opponent’s body for more impact, giving them +1 DV when inflicting damage.

## Tricking

This technique covers a mix of martial arts and gymnastics involving showmanship and flair with lots of jumping and flips. It includes such maneuvers as the 540 kick, butterfly twist, and double roundhouse. Tricking also covers a display of spinning and flashing the character’s weapon around his body. Such maneuvers are difficult to perform, but they can be effective in intimidating the untrained in not wanting to fight. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Trick Shot).

## Two-headed Snake

This technique is all about misdirection and misrepresentation, focusing on not giving away any tells in your technique. It also involves a little method acting to give the opponent a false impression of your status. It reduces the penalty by 1 for Called Shot (Feint) (Close Combat only).

## Two-weapon Style Attack

(CLUBS/BLADES ONLY)

Eskrima’s double baraw or double daga, Ryoto Jutto and modern fencing with sword and dagger are all examples of martial arts that train people how to fight with a weapon in each hand. Each weapon can only have a reach of 1 or 0. Two-weapon style combat treats both weapons as one. When attacking, use the lesser Reach of the two weapons, but add 1 to the Accuracy and Damage Value of the longer weapon. The character must be able and ready to use a weapon in each hand in order to perform this style of attack.

## Two-weapon Style Defense

(CLUBS/BLADES ONLY)

This two-weapon style technique is more specific to defense of the character. The character receives a 2 dice bonus when using Full Defense against Close Combat attacks. The character must be able and ready to use a weapon in each hand in order to perform this style of defense.

## Yielding Force

Opposite of Opposing Force, Yielding Force is the practice of using the opponent’s force against him. It provides +1 die to Riposte, +1 die to Counter Strike, or +1 die to Throw (Including both the Throw Person and Sacrificial Throw actions). Characters only receive one of these bonuses, as indicated in their particular Martial Art style.
