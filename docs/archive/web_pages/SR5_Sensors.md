## Grenade-Cam

A dodecahedron-shaped multi-purpose sensor platform twice the size of a baseball, the G-Cam is usually thrown into an unknown area. Its reinforced casing is strong enough to survive a twenty-meter fall, and its shape ensures that it will eventually stop rolling. Multiple sensor apertures enable the G-Cam to obtain three-dimensional images of an area. Image link comes standard, and extra sensor options can be added.
