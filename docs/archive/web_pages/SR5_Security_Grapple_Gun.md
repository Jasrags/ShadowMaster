This gun can shoot a grappling hook and attached rope, using [Light Crossbow ranges](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Weapons:Ballistic_Projectiles "SR5:Weapons:Ballistic Projectiles"). It comes equipped with an internal winch to pull back the grapple (or pull up small loads). Use the Exotic Ranged Weapon skill to shoot it. Micro rope can support a weight of up to 100 kilograms; standard and stealth ropes can support a weight of up to 400 kilograms.

## Catalyst Stick

| When stealth rope is touched with the catalyst stick, the chemical reaction that is triggered crumbles the rope to dust within seconds, leaving almost no trace. The catalyst stick is reusable. |

## Microwire

| This micro rope is made of an extremely thin (nearly monofilament) and resilient fiber; a great length of it can be stored in a very small compartment, and it is very difficult to see. The downside is that it can only be grabbed with protective rappelling gloves without slicing straight through the climber’s hands, inflicting 8P damage with an AP of –8. |

## Myomeric rope

|Description=
Made of a special myomeric fiber, this rope’s movement can be controlled remotely (over a maximum length of thirty meters). For example, the controller can wind it like a snake to reach around an obstacle or tie to a ledge. The rope moves at a rate of two meters per Combat Turn.
