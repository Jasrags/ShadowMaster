# Fixed-Wing

Fixed wing aircraft are operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill.

## Artemis Nightwing

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| HANDL | SPEED | ACCEL | BOD | ARMOR | PILOT | SENSOR | SEATS | AVAIL | COST    | SOURCE |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | --- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 6     | 3     | 1     | 4   | 0     | 1     | 18     | 6     | 8     | 20,000¥ | Core   |

| | |
| The Nightwing is an older model ultra-light, closely resembling those that originated in the late twentieth century. The Nightwing has a shrouded electric motor to minimize aircraft sound and reduce heat emissions—while this has a stated purpose of preventing noise pollution and environmental impact, it has the side effect of making the small, glider-like craft quite stealthy. The Nightwing is popular with rural aviation enthusiasts, smugglers, and anyone who favors a classic stealth insertion. |

## Cessna C750

| This amphibious jet is great for heavy cargo and personnel hauling and doesn’t need an airfield to land. It is used by corporate logistics teams for resupply of out-of-the-way facilities and by Awakened game hunters and poachers to reach their dangerous game. This craft is amphibious and comes standard with buoyancy and flotation upgrades, meaning it can take off from land and water. |

| | |
| This lightning-fast, supersonic aircraft is the classic, iconic t-bird, and it has the armor, armaments, and sensor suites to prove it. This LAV sees military use in reconnaissance and courier duty, and is a favorite of elite smugglers for white-knuckle illegal border crossings, with its ability to fly under the radar through canyons at high speeds. |

## Federated Boeing Commuter

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| | |
| This tilt-wing passenger aircraft sees heavy use as an inter-city shuttle, hopping between corporate-controlled aerospaceports and ferrying sararimen around the world. Shadowrunners are unlikely to use it as their own equipment, but they may run into it, particularly if they’re on an extraction or executive-protection detail. |
