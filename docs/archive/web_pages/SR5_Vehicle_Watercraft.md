| | |
| This mid-size craft is mainly used for pleasure boating, fishing, light hauling, and utility work. A five-meter-long vessel with a fiberglass open hull, the Otter is a well-rounded, general-purpose boat that doesn’t stand out in any one area. |

## Yongkang Gala Trinity

| | |
| This small, fast-moving speedboat is known as a smuggler’s craft. It’s generally built on the spot using prepared components and a hull kit, assembled with its payload built right into the hull; then on arrival, the Trinity is taken apart around its cargo, with the profit of the haul compensating for the fact the boat was used only once. |

## Morgan Cutlass

| Weapons 2 Weapon Mounts | |
| This commonly seen patrol boat comes equipped with a pair of heavy, manually operated weapon mounts (usually outfitted with LMGs) and a high-quality sensor suite. |

| Storage Drone Rack for Single Medium Drone | |
| This underwater sea-sled is used for underwater inspection and transportation. with riding positions for up to four scuba-equipped passengers (while closest to a submarine, the Lamprey does not actually protect its passengers from the rigors of the deep). Military models of the lamprey are used for aquatic insertions by specially equipped naval spec ops forces, like the UCAS Navy SEAL teams. The lamprey also includes a drone rack for a single seaworthy drone of medium or smaller size for exploring at deeper depths than the passengers can safely go. |

| This two-person mini-sub is the cheapest available in its class and is available in a wide selection of utility models. It is often used on patrol and short-range reconnaissance duties and resupply runs, but it can also be leveraged by shadowrunner teams looking for unexpected ways to approach nautical targets. |
