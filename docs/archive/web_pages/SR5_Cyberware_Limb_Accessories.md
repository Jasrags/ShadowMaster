## Cyberarm Gyromount

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | [8] | 12F | 6,000¥ | Core |

| De/Activate Simple Action Recoil Compensation 3 Wireless Activating or deactivating the system is a Free Action. |  |
| This accessory must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you. The effects are identical to a gyro stabilization system (p. 432), only with Rating 3 (this effect is not cumulative with a worn gyro stabilization system). Activating or deactivating the system is a Simple Action. |

| You can hold a taser or any pistol or smaller-sized weapon within the holster, completely enclosed until you activate it. Inserting or retrieving a weapon takes one Simple Action. A cyber holster can also be used as a smuggling compartment to store items no larger than a pistol (the gamemaster has final discretion). |

| This implant requires you to have two cyberlegs with a hydraulic jack of identical Ratings in each leg. Each Rating point adds a +1 to your Physical limit for jumping and sprinting, adds twenty percent to your maximum jump distance, and reduces your falling distance by two meters for the purpose of calculating falling damage. |
