| Skill Pilot Aircraft Style Insectoid | |
| This Mitsuhama drone is the size and shape of a large insect but can achieve substantially better altitudes. It can serve in an “eye in the sky” role and is handy for shadowing people given the fact that it’s relatively hard to spot. This drone is operated with the Pilot Aircraft skill. |

| Skill Pilot Aircraft Style Sphere Modifications Flash-Pack and Smoke Grenade for 500¥ extra | |
| This spherical flying drone uses omnidirectional thrust nozzles to stay airborne. Just about eyeball-sized, it can roll itself on the ground, though it needs to fly to overcome obstructions like stairs and curbs. A version with a built-in flash-pak and smoke grenade costs 500¥ extra; detonating them destroys the drone. Use Pilot Aircraft to operate. |
