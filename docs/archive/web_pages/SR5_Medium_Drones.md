| Skill Pilot Walker Style Humanoid Weapons Blade-Arms with Autosoft Rating 3 Targeting (Swords) |  |
| This medium-sized, roughly anthromorph walker drone is an oddity, some might say a novelty. It is designed to patrol on its two feet like a metahuman security guard and is equipped with blade-arms as its primary armaments. Furthermore, it has been stylized so its outer chassis represents the traditional oyoroi samurai armor worn by the Renraku Red Samurai, perhaps a subtle jab at a competing mega. A niche item that is seldom fielded, the duelist has two distinct advantages: its humanoid profile allows it to be mistaken for a more-versatile metahuman guard at a distance, making it useful at facilities guarded by skeleton crews, and its blade-arms are allegedly marginally more effective at combating spirits than the traditional drone combat payloads of guns and more guns. This drone comes with a unique Rating 3 Targeting (Swords) autosoft and mounts a pair of standard swords in special weapon mounts. (The mounted swords cannot be replaced with other weapons, but additional weapon mounts may be installed using the normal rules.) This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill. |
