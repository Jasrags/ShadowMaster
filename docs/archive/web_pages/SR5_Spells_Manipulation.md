Manipulation spells control, animate, or transform matter and energy. There are a number of keywords for manipulation spells.

Damaging
: Manipulation spells that cause damage have a Damage Value equal to their Force (unaltered by hits on the Spellcasting test) and 0 AP. The damage is resisted with Body + Armor.

Mental
: Targets resist these spells with Logic + Willpower. Keep track of your net hits, as they determine how long you can sustain the spell. While the spell is sustained, the target may take a Complex Action on their turn to resist by making a Logic + Willpower Test with a dice pool penalty equal to the spell’s Force; every hit the target gets reduces the caster’s net hits by 1. The one being controlled can take this action even if they wouldn’t get an action because of the spell. The spell ends when your net hits are reduced to zero.
: A victim of mental manipulation spell may roll to notice the magical effect according to the usual rules for Perceiving Magic (p. 280). Some of the less subtle mental spells (Control Actions) are pretty obvious, but more subtle spells (like Control Thoughts) can be pretty insidious.

Environmental
: These spells don’t really have a target, and they don’t really affect targets directly. They just affect an area.

Physical
: These spells affect physical forms and are usually defended against with a living target’s Body + Strength or an inanimate object’s Object Resistance dice pool.

## Animate, Mass Animate

| ANIMATE         |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F - 1 | **Source:** Core |

| MASS ANIMATE     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S  | **Drain:** F + 1   | **Source:** Core |

This spell causes inanimate objects to move. The object moves according to its structure (balls can roll, rugs may crawl, humanoid statues can walk, and so on). The spell imparts a limited flexibility, allowing solid objects such as statues to shamble a bit as if they had joints. You need to get net successes against the target’s Object Resistance (p. 295); larger items (over 200 kilograms) have their resistance increased by 2 for every full 200 kilos they weigh. Controlling the object takes only a Simple Action; objects can also be ordered to maintain their movement while you direct your attention elsewhere. You only have rough control over the object’s movement and can’t manipulate individual parts or components (finer control requires a spell like Magic Fingers, p. 294). The maximum movement rate for objects is (Force) meters per turn, subject to the gamemaster’s discretion. If the object is held by someone else, you need to win an Opposed Test using Force x 2 against the holder’s Strength + Body to break the object free. If it’s fastened, make this Force x 2 Success Test against an appropriate gamemaster-determined threshold.

Animate affects a single non-living object; Mass Animate is an area spell that can get a number of objects moving at once (like a room full of brooms, for example).

## Armor

| ARMOR           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F - 2 | **Source:** Core |

This spell creates a glowing field of magical energy around the subject that protects against Physical Damage. It provides Armor equal to the hits scored and is cumulative with other armor. It is not included in any calculations to determine armor encumbrance (see Armor and Encumbrance, p. 169).

## Control Actions, Mob Control

| CONTROL ACTIONS |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (MENTAL)        |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

| MOB CONTROL     |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (MENTAL, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F + 1   | **Source:** Core |

You control the physical actions of your target like a puppeteer pulling strings. The victim’s consciousness is unaffected, but you control the victim’s body. Use your own skills when forcing your target to perform actions. It takes a Complex Action to make the target perform any action.

Control Actions only affects a single target, Mob Control affects any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of Mob Control may be manipulated individually (with separate actions) or issued the same command as a group (with a single action).

## Control Thoughts, Mob Mind

| CONTROL THOUGHTS |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (MENTAL)         |
| **Type:** M      | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S  | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

| MOB MIND        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (MENTAL, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F + 1 | **Source:** Core |

The magician seizes control of the target’s mind, directing everything the target thinks. The magician mentally gives commands with a Standard Action, and the target is compelled to obey as if it were his own idea.

Control Thoughts affects a single target, while Mob Mind affects any living targets within the area of effect. Victims of a Mob Mind may be manipulated individually (with separate actions) or issued the same command as a group (with a single action).

## Fling

| FLING                |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL, DAMAGING) |
| **Type:** P          | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** I      | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

This spell psychokinetically hurls a single object of no more than (Force) kilograms at a designated target. Use your Spellcasting Test in place of a normal Ranged Combat Test for the purposes of the item hitting the target, and use your Magic instead of Strength for determining Damage Value and range. Use standard grenade ranges (see Range Table, p. 185)

## Ice Sheet

| ICE SHEET             |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** I       | **Drain:** F       | **Source:** Core |

This spell creates a slipper y sheet of ice over the area of ef fect. Characters crossing the ice must make an Agility + Reaction Test with a threshold equal to the hits you score to avoid falling prone. Vehicles must make an immediate Crash Test (p. 201). The sheet melts at a rate of 1 square meter per minute at room temperature (faster when it ’s hotter, slower when it ’s colder, or not at all if it ’s below freezing).

## Ignite

| IGNITE          |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** P | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

The Ignite spell accelerates molecular motion in the target, causing it to catch fire once the spell becomes permanent. Against non-living targets, the magician must succeed against the target ’s Object Resistance dice pool. Once the target ignites, it burns normally until it is consumed or extinguished.

Against living targets, treat Ignite as a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] v. Body + Reaction Test. If successful, the spell wraps a living target in heat and flames, eventually setting the target on fire (Fire Damage p. 171).

## Influence

| INFLUENCE       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (MENTAL)        |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** P | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

You implant a single suggestion in the victim’s mind, like a powerful post-hypnotic command. For example, you might have your target think that FizzyFluid is the best drink on the market, or that he can’t remember his best friend’s name, or that he should let you past a locked door. The target carries out this suggestion as if it were his own idea. If confronted with the wrongness of the suggestion (like when the reality of the flavor of FizzyFluid in his mouth contrasts with his belief that it’s good), the subject can attempt to overcome it using the rules for overcoming mental manipulations (p. 292). In any case, the suggestion fades naturally after a number of minutes equal to your net hits.

## Levitate

| LEVITATE        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

Levitate allows you to telekinetically lift a person or object and move it around. You have to beat a threshold equal to the subject’s mass divided by 200 kilograms, rounded up. The subject of the spell can be moved anywhere in your line of sight at a movement rate equal to the spell’s Force in meters per Combat Turn.

If you’re trying to levitate an item held by a living being, or levitate an unwilling living being, that being can defend against the Spellcasting Test with Strength + Body. You can use this spell to levitate yourself, if you need a view from a higher perspective or desire some parachute-free sky diving.

## Light

| LIGHT                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F –     | **Source:** Core |

This spell creates a mobile point of light, illuminating a radius around it equal to the spell’s Force in meters. The spell cannot be used to blind a target, but it offsets darkness visibility modifiers. Each hit on the Spellcasting Test counters a –1 die penalty due to light conditions.

## Magic Fingers

| MAGIC FINGERS   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

Magic Fingers creates a psychokinetic effect as a sort of invisible hand that can hold or manipulate items. The hits on the Spellcasting + Magic Test become the spell’s effective Strength and Agility. You can use skills remotely with Magic Fingers, replacing your inherent limits with the spell’s Force. The spell has problems with fine control, so even simple actions such as picking up a coin may require a test (at the gamemaster’s discretion). You can fight, pick a lock, or perform any other action, using the magic fingers as if they were your real hands. The magic fingers can manipulate objects within your line of sight, but only objects within a meter or so of one another at any given moment (the “hands” can’t be farther away from each other than your arm span). This spell comes in very handy (no pun intended) for disarming bombs and handling other hazardous work from a safe distance.

## Mana Barrier

| MANA BARRIER          |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 2   | **Source:** Core |

Mana Barrier creates an invisible barrier of magical energy. It has a barrier rating equal to the net hits scored and follows the rules for mana barriers (p. 315). This barrier does not restrict living beings or physical objects, but it impedes spirits, foci, dual beings, and spells on the plane in which you cast it (physical or astral). If cast on the astral plane, it also impedes astral forms and reduces visibility.

## Physical Barrier

| PHYSICAL BARRIER      |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F - 1   | **Source:** Core |

This spell creates a glowing, translucent force field with 1 point of both Armor and Structure rating per hit. You can form the barrier as a dome with a radius and height equal to the spell’s normal radius. Alternately, you can use it to form a wall with a height equal to the spell’s Force and a length equal to its Force x 2.Physical Barrier creates a physical wall. Anything the size of a molecule (or less) can pass through the barrier, including air or other gases. Anything bigger treats the barrier as a normal physical wall. The wall is translucent but shimmers, the equivalent of Light Fog (p. 175). The barrier does not impede spellcasting (other than visibility penalties), except for spells with physical components like indirect combat spells. The barrier can be brought down by physical attacks, but as long as you sustain it will regenerate all of its Structure Rating at the beginning of each Combat Turn. If the barrier is reduced to Structure Rating 0, it collapses and the spell ends.

## Poltergeist

| POLTERGEIST           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F - 2   | **Source:** Core |

Poltergeist picks up all small objects (up to a kilogram in mass) within the spell’s area and whirls them around in random patterns. This creates the equivalent visibility penalty of Light Fog (p. 175). The spell inflicts 2 boxes of Stun damage (resisted with Body + Armor) to anyone in the area each Combat Turn, whacking them with flying debris. Poltergeist may do more damage in cluttered environments, or inflict Physical damage if the gamemaster feels the debris is sufficiently dangerous (broken glass and nails, for example). If there is no debris lying around, this spell doesn’t do much more than make a spooky noise.

## Shadow

| SHADOW                |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 3   | **Source:** Core |

Shadow creates a globe of darkness with a radius equal to the spell’s Force in meters. For every two hits, increase the light penalty (p. 175) by one catagory—2 hits for Partial Light, 4 hits for Dim Light, and 6 hits for Total Darkness. This spell doesn’t cause more than Total Darkness.

## Bind, Net Bind, Mana Bind, Mana Net

| BIND            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| NET BIND         |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S  | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| MANA BIND       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MANA)          |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| MANA NET        |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (MANA, AREA)    |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This set of spells is used by the spellcaster to bind a target with invisible bands of magical energy that impede movement. Every net hit reduces the target’s Agility by 1. If Agility is reduced to 0, the target is bound and unable to move his limbs. While bound by the spell, the target may attempt to crawl or hop short distances (at one-quarter their normal movement rate). Bound targets may still defend and dodge against attacks, but they suffer a dice-pool modifier equal to the caster’s net hits. A bound target may attempt to break free of the bindings by making an Opposed Test, pitting Strength + Body against the spell’s Force x 2.

Bind works on single targets, while Net Bind is an area spell. These spells may be used against inanimate objects such as drones to restrict moving or rotating parts, though this may not stop some drones and vehicles, depending on their method of propulsion.

Mana Bind and Mana Net work against astral or dual-natured entities, and the Opposed Test to break free is Willpower + Charisma vs. spell’s Force x 2.

Mana Bind only works on a single living or magical target, while Mana Net is an area spell that works against living/magical targets.

## Bug Zapper

| BUG ZAPPER            |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F + 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Bug Zapper is a modified version of the Mana Barrier spell (p. 294, SR5) designed to work against insect spirits and insect spirit powers. After the fall of Chicago, this spell started to become quite popular as the “Bug Menace” grew in importance. When cast on the physical plane, Spirit Zapper impedes materialized spirits, creating a mana-based object that “zaps” any insect spirits that come into contact with it. The barrier inflicts Physical damage equal to its Force. Otherwise, Bug Zapper functions the same as Mana Barrier. Note that this spell does not damage any other types of spirits or astral forms.

## Calm Animal, Calm Pack

| CALM ANIMAL     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MENTAL)        |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| CALM PACK       |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (MENTAL, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Calm Animal allows a spellcaster to calm any non-sapient creature (normal or paranormal), making it non-aggressive while the spell is sustained. Calm Animal affects a single creature, while Calm Pack is an area spell. Affected animals still defend themselves if attacked.

## Catfall

| CATFALL         |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

A spellcaster may utilize Catfall to slow a target’s fall to help him land safely without suffering falling damage (p. 172, SR5). Gamemasters can determine the maximum distance (in meters) the target may fall without danger of injury by multiplying the spellcaster’s hits by the spell’s Force. If the target falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell before calculating damage.

## Clean Element

| CLEAN [ELEMENT]       |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P       | **Drain:** F – 3   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Clean [Element] is an area spell that clears all impurities out of the volume of a particular element within range. Each element requires a different spell (Clean Air, Clean Water, etc.). For example, Clean Air could be used to cleanse a room of toxic fumes, or Clean Water could purify a drinking supply. The caster’s hits determine how thoroughly the element is cleaned; slightly muddy water would require only 1 hit to clean, while contaminated runoff water could require four hits to make it drinkable. The amount of an element cleaned equals the caster’s Magic Rating x 10 in cubic meters.

## Compel Truth

| COMPEL TRUTH          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MENTAL)              |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** Special | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Compel Truth is a spell that forces the target to speak only the truth as she knows it. The target can say something he or she believes to be true, even if it is not. The subject may choose not to speak or to withhold information but cannot directly lie. Some jurisdictions (like the UCAS) consider the use of this spell by law enforcement authorities to be a violation of a suspect’s right against self-incrimination. Others have been known to use this spell (among others) to get to the truth in legal cases. The spell lasts for a number of minutes equal to the hits on the Spellcasting Test.

## Control Animal, Control Pack

| CONTROL ANIMAL  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MENTAL)        |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| CONTROL PACK    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MENTAL, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This set of spells is a variant of Control Thoughts and Mob Mind (p. 293, SR5) designed to work on non-sapient animals (both normal and paranormal). The spellcaster first seizes control of the animals’ minds and actions and then may issue verbal commands that must be obeyed with a Simple Action. Gamemasters should consider the intelligence of the targeted animal and the complexity of the command when determining how effectively the targeted animal obeys.

Control Animal affects a single creature; Control Pack is an area spell.

## Deflection

| DEFLECTION      |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Deflection grants the spellcaster the ability to cast a spell of protection over a willing target. Every hit scored grants the target a +1 dice pool modifier for defending against ranged physical attacks. The effects of this spell are subtle enough to be discounted as a missed shot or poor aim (at least at first).

## Element Aura

| [ELEMENT] AURA  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL) |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F + 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

[Element] Aura creates a rippling aura of elemental energies around a willing subject’s body, granting her some of the properties of said element. Each element requires a different spell such as Flame Aura, Electrical Aura, Cold Aura, and so on. Said auras increase the Damage Value of any melee attacks by the caster’s hits depending upon the nature of the element. Attacks are also treated as **[Cold](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage#Cold_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**, **[Electricity](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage#Electricity_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**, **[Fire](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage#Fire_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**, or some other **[Elemental Damage](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**, and have the armor penetration appropriate to each attack. Any successful physical melee attack against the subject also means that the attacker must resist similar damage from the aura.

## Element Wall

| [ELEMENT] WALL        |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F + 2   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

[Element] Wall allows the spellcaster to create a wall composed of the specified element named in the spell. Each element requires a different spell, such as Fire Wall, Ice Wall, Smoke Wall, and so on. The elemental wall may have a height and length up to the spell’s Force in meters. Alternatively, the caster may craft a dome with a radius and height equal to half the Force in meters. The width of the wall can be up to one meter. The caster may adjust this size if he has the Spll Shaping metamagic (p. 326, SR5).

Anyone coming into contact with the wall suffers special damage as appropriate to the element (p. 170, SR5), with a Damage Value equal to the spell’s Force. Note that some elemental walls (fire, smoke, etc.) are not solid and do not block attacks, though they may inflict Visibility modifiers as determined by the gamemaster. Solid walls (earth, ice, etc.) have an Armor and Structure rating equal to the caster’s Spellcasting hits.

## Fashion

| FASHION               |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** T(A)  | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P       | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This spell instantly tailors clothing, transforming garments into any fashion the caster wishes. The net hits over the clothing’s object resistance (defense pool for the clothing can be between 6 and 9, depending on the complexity of the material and whether it interweaves electronics into the threads) measure the degree of style in the tailoring. The spell cannot change clothing’s protective value, only its cut, color, pattern, and fit. The weight of the clothing does not change, and it must cover approximately the same amount of area (for example, a jumpsuit can’t be converted into a bikini). The caster must touch the clothing.

| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | The tint of the color can change (e.g., dark blue to light blue, but not blue to green); minor adjustments such as mending bullet holes can also be performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2        | Adjustments to the fit of the clothing can be made, but nothing drastic about the nature of the clothes (for example, pants are still pants). Color can change slightly (e.g., blue to green or purple, but not red).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3        | Full spectrum of color can be manipulated. Simple geometric patterns and designs can be added, but nothing as elaborate as corporate logos or name tags. Modifications such as the addition or removal of pockets or pants to a skirt can be done. Repairs and cleaning of the clothing can also be performed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 4+       | Clothing can be changed with enough specificity to mimic a uniform, provided enough material is available. Color changes can help mimic missing accessories such as buttons, labels, badges, ribbons, etc. These changes, however, are only convincing at a distance if the physical accessories are not present. The closer a target gets to the subject, the more likely they will notice the actual accessories are missing (a gamemaster would call for a Perception Test to see if the per- son notices). Patterns and designs on clothing can be as intricate as the magician desires. |

## Fix

| FIX             |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P | **Drain:** F | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Most spellcasters have devoted their efforts towards learning spells rather than mechanics. This can leave a magician in a bad situation when there is a need for an emergency repair during a run. Fix allows the spellcaster to repair damage to non-living materials, including drones and vehicles. The caster must first touch the object and then achieve enough hits to beat the item’s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5).

Fix can repair any item with a weight equal to the Force x the spellcaster’s hits in kilograms or less. This spell can only repair broken items when all the pieces are present. The weight limit applies to the damaged part, not necessarily the entire vehicle. For example, if you have a busted wheel, you would count that weight not the weight of the entire vehicle. Each hit scored repairs 1 point of Structure rating or 1 box of damage. An object may only be affected by Fix once and thereafter may not be repaired again by this spell.

## Gecko Crawl

| GECKO CRAWL     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Gecko Crawl spell allows the caster to grant a willing subject the ability to walk along vertical or overhead surfaces at a movement rate equal to Force x hits in meters per turn. Although the subject has amazing climbing abilities for the duration of the spell, he is still affected by gravity and will fall if his hands or feet are physically separated from the surface. The gamemaster may elect to require Climbing Tests in order for the subject to climb especially slick surfaces.

## Glue, Glue Strip

| GLUE            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| GLUE STRIP       |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P  | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Glue allows the spellcaster to bond a target to any one surface to which it is currently in contact. The target must be touching the surface at the time of the spellcasting. The caster must beat the surface’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) in order to create the mystical bond. Pulling the two surfaces apart requires an Opposed Test between the spell’s Force x 2 and the separator’s Strength + Body. If a target or surface has a Body or Structure rating lower than the spell’s Force, the skin/surface will be torn apart in the process of being separated (suffering Physial damage equal to the difference).

Glue affects a single target, Glue Strip is an area spell.

## Increase/Decrease Noise

| INCREASE NOISE  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL) |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS(A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3  | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| DECREASE NOISE  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL) |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS(A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1  | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Noise is the static on the wireless Matrix that saps your signal and slows down your access (p. 230, SR5). Spellcasters can leverage this set of spells to artificially increase or decrease the noise within the range of the spell. The spellcaster is not immune to her alternations of the noise and may indeed be hoisted on her own petard should she attempt to use the Matrix after she has increased the noise.

The spellcaster must achieve enough hits to beat thresholds as follows: public grid (2), local grid (4), global grid (6). Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the noise of the Matrix by 1 within the boundaries of the spell. For more information about the effects of noise and the Matrix, refer to the chart on p. 231, SR5.

Unusual changes in the noise of a specific area may attract undue attention and increase the Overwatch Score (p. 231, SR5). For every net hit on the Spellcasting Test above 4, increase all Overwatch Scores of hackers in the affected area by 1D6 per minute

## Increase/Decrease Gear Limits

| INCREASE GEAR LIMITS |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)           |
| **Type:** P          | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S      | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| DECREASE GEAR LIMITS |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)           |
| **Type:** P          | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S      | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Quality gear isn’t always easy to come by in a tight spot. Sometimes a runner has to make do with what she can scrounge. This set of spells allows a spellcaster to temporarily upgrade or downgrade targeted gear by increasing a single limitation category, such as Accuracy (p. 417, SR5). Wily spellcasters secretly use Decrease Gear Limits to sabotage rivals and enemies without them ever suspecting the true the instrument of their downfall.

The caster must first touch the object, select a single limit to affect, and then achieve enough hits to beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5). Only one limit may be altered at a time for any particular piece of gear. Each net hit achieved increases or reduces the target’s selected inherent limit by 1, to a minimum of 1. Increase Gear Limits increases the limit of a subject while Decrease Gear Limits decreases the limits of a target.

## Interference

| INTERFERENCE     |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S  | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Interference floods the airwaves with electromagnetic jamming signals to block out wireless and radio communications. Each net hit from the caster increases the Noise by one just like a jammer (p. 441, SR5). Sadly, the spellcaster’s personal equipment is not immune to this spell.

## Lock

| LOCK            |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Lock allows the spellcaster to telekinetically hold a door (or portal, hatch, closure, or similar blockage) closed with a Strength equal to the Force. The caster must beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) to hold the blockade into place. Opening the portal requires an Opposed Test between Strength and the spell’s Force.

## Mana Static

| MANA STATIC           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P       | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Mana Static allows the spellcaster to create a background count that impedes magical activities. For every hit scored by the caster, the background count is increased by 1. Once the spell is made permanent, the background count from this spell recedes at a rate of 1 point per hour. Mana Static affects everyone in the affected area, including the caster.

## Makeover

| MAKEOVER        |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** P | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Makeover allows the spellcaster to grant a “makeover” to voluntary subject that mystically alters cosmetics, hair color and style, and nails. These changes are magical in nature and do not depend upon the caster’s knowledge of grooming or fashion. The effects of the makeover are as permanent as those made physically in a beauty salon. Each hit scored by the caster measures the degree of style and skill in the makeover.

## Mist

| MIST                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I       | **Drain:** F – 3   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Mist creates a thick fog that blankets the entire area of effect. The mist is dense and difficult to see through, imposing a visibility modifier equal to the hits scored by the caster. The mist dissipates quickly based on the surrounding temperature and winds. Generally speaking, this means the vision modifier is reduced by 1 per Combat Turn, though gamemasters may make this reduction slower in cool, damp areas and faster in hot, dry areas.

## Offensive Mana Barrier

| OFFENSIVE MANA BARRIER |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F + 3   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Offensive Mana Barrier is an amped-up version of the Mana Barrier spell (p. 294, SR5). It allows the spellcaster create a mana barrier that “zaps” any spirits, dual beings, or astral forms that come into contact with it. The barrier inflicts Physical damage equal to its Force. Otherwise, Offensive Mana Barrier functions the same as Mana Barrier.

## Preserve

| PRESERVE         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I  | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Preserve allows the spellcaster to keep inert organic matter from drying out, decaying, or putrefying. It can be used on such mundane things as food and drink, but it is most often used by forensic spellcasters to protect cadavers from decay before autopsy, or to preserve small organic samples (hair, skin) taken from a crime scene for use as a material link (p. 296, SR5). The amount of time the material stays fresh and preserved is determined by the Spellcasting hits; multiply the number of hits + 1 by the time matter would normally stay fresh to determine how long it lasts. For example, 4 hits would preserve a substance for 5 times as long as it would normally last.

## Protect Vehicle

| PROTECT VEHICLE  |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P      | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S  | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

A wily magician knows how to protect her getaway vehicle from rival spellcasters. Protect Vehicle casts a protective barrier over a targeted vehicle. The caster must beat the surface’s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5) in order to create the mystical bond between the caster and the vehicle. Each net hit scored by the caster then increases the vehicle’s Object Resistance Test by 1. In addition, for the duration of the spell, the caster may share her Spell Defense with the entire vehicle and its occupants. Note that only one target within the vehicle, or the vehicle itself, may utilize said Spell Defense during a single Combat Turn.

## Pulse

| PULSE                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I       | **Drain:** F + 3   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Pulse sends out a brief, highly charged burst of electromagnetic energy, emanating from the spellcaster, that plays havoc with electrical systems. This spell erases standard RFID tags and may affect other non-optical and non-hardened electronic circuit systems within the range of the spell. Most modern electronics are optical-based, but they still have some electronic components that this spell can effect. It also can affect some archaic devices and power systems. All such devices within the spell’s range, no matter who owns them, are affected.

The caster must beat the item’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5) to affect it with Pulse. Affected systems may suffer data loss, power outages, or burn out entirely at the gamemaster’s discretion. The number of net hits scored by the caster determines the level of disruption of the systems within the range of the Pulse. In addition, Pulse also disrupts wireless reception and radio communication for a brief instant.

## Reinforce

| REINFORCE       |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Reinforce allows the spellcaster to increase the structural integrity of an object no larger than caster’s Magic in square meters. Each hit scored by the caster increases both the Armor and Structure rating by 1 as long as the spell is sustained.

## Slow Vehicle

| SLOW VEHICLE    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F + 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Slow Vehicle is a dangerous spell that magicians use as a last report when an enemy is getting away and there isn’t any way to stop them. Should the caster achieve enough hits to beat the vehicle’s Object Resistance Test (p. 295, SR5), she may physically absorb excess kinetic energy causing a decrease in relative speed. For every net hit scored, the caster may decrease the Speed Attribute for the targeted vehicle by one. This spell can be quite effective in slowing a target down during a chase. If the driver is unfamiliar with the effects of this spell, the gamemaster may require a Stunt action to keep the vehicle steady (p. 204, SR5).

## Shape Material

| SHAPE [MATERIAL]      |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 2   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Shape [Material] allows the spellcaster to move and shape a volume of a specified inorganic element or material (air, earth, water, fire, mud, lava, plasteel, concrete, tar, etc.) within range of the spell. First, the caster must beat the material’s **[Object Resistance](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Magic_Rules#Other_Tables "SR5:Magic Rules")** Test and then mentally command it to his whims. The material can be moved and reshaped in any way the caster desires at a maximum Movement Rate of (net hits) meters per turn. Loose material can be moved and re-shaped easily, but material that is connected or reinforced (such as walls or other material part of a structure) must be broken apart by reducing its Structure Rating by Force points per Combat Turn. This spell allows the caster to rapidly dig holes, redirect streams, fill balloons, create a path through a fire, construct a barricade, or create a doorway where one didn’t exist before.

Each element/material requires a separate spell such as Shape Sand, Shape Ice, Shape Wood, Shape Concrete, and so on. Elements or materials reshaped by the caster remain frozen in that form when the spell ends. If that form cannot be supported by the material, it will collapse into rumble. The material/element can also be spread out, extinguished, or evaporated. For example, a fire could be extinguished by reducing the Power by the caster’s Spellcasting hits each turn.

## Shapechange, Critter Form

| SHAPECHANGE     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| (CRITTER) FORM  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 4 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Shapechange transforms a voluntary subject into a normal (non-paranormal) critter, though the subject retains human consciousness. The subject can only assume the form of a critter whose base Body Rating is 2 points greater or less than her own. Consult the Critters section, (p. 392, SR5) for the subject’s Physical attributes while in critter form. The caster may increase any base critter Physical Attribute one point for each net hit scored. Her Mental attributes remain unchanged.

This spell does not transform clothing and equipment. Magicians in critter form can still cast spells but cannot perform tasks requiring speech. The subject may not turn into a swarm.

Critter form works like the Shapechange spell but only allows the subject to change into a specific non-paranormal animal. Each critter form is a different spell (dog form, shark Form, and so on).

## Spirit Barrier, Spirit Zapper

| SPIRIT BARRIER        |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| SPIRIT ZAPPER         |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F + 1   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This is modified version of the Mana Barrier spell (p. 294, SR5) designed to work again spirits and spirit powers. When cast on the physical plane, Spirit Zapper impedes materialized spirits. It has no effect on spells, foci, or non-spirit dual beings and astral forms.

## Sterilize

| STERILIZE             |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ENVIRONMENTAL, AREA) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I       | **Drain:** F – 3   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This spell allows a spellcaster to kill all bacteria (and other microorganisms) and destroy organic material such as skin flakes, stray hairs, and spilled blood. Material affected by this spell cannot be used as a material link. Because the spell does not affect biomaterial attached to a living being, it does not kill the various helpful and harmful microorganisms living inside a creature. Each hit scored by the caster inflicts a –1 dice pool modifier to any skill tests made to collect and use sterilized biomaterial for forensics or material link purposes. Shadowrunners often employ this spell to eliminate incriminating trace evidence, especially if blood has been spilled. The area sterilized equals the caster’s Magic Rating in cubic meters.

## Turn to Goo

| TURN TO GOO     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PHYSICAL)      |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F + 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Turn to Goo allows a spellcaster to transform living tissue into a sticky, glue-like substance. The caster must win an Opposed Test pitting her Magic + Spellcasting against the target’s Body (+ Counterspelling). Additionally, the spell’s Force must equal or exceed the target’s Body. Non-living material—including clothing, gear, and cyberware—are not affected.

The target is not conscious while under the effects of this spell, and any damage suffered by the gooey form affects the target normally. The goo has a barrier Armor Rating equal to the Body + net hits (see Barriers, p. 364, SR5). Cyberware remains still, as though frozen in amber. If removed, the target may suffer significant physical damage (depending on what is removed) as determined by the gamemaster.

## Catch

| Catch           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MANIPULATION)  |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** LOS   | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I | **Drain:** F - 2 | **Source:** SR5:HT |

This is something like Fling, but in the other direction. This spell allows you to quickly yank one individual unattended object (up to Force in kilos) into your hand. The maximum range is your Magic in meters. It is exceptionally useful for retrieving a dropped gun or a thrown weapon. Or winning the egg toss.

## Conceal Scent

| CONCEAL SCENT   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (MANIPULATION)  |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F - 3 | **Source:** SR5:HT |

This spell removes scent traces from an object and is a favorite of smugglers looking to fool man’s best friend or individuals trying to slip explosives past security checkpoints. Any scent-based Perception Tests take a dice pool penalty equal to the hits scored on this spell.

## Snakeblood

| SNAKEBLOOD      |

Spellblades are a product of a failed line of research by MCT. Attempts to create a sustained damaging connection of energy failed to yield the desired results, but they resulted in a maintained extension of a spell, based on the formulas for Manabolt and Powerbolt. These spells could yield a field of energy roughly the same space as a sword, maintained for as long as the caster could concentrate. The formula was altered to allow the caster to “hold” onto the spell at a point analogous to a grip, though the “blade” portion of the spell remained dangerous. It was found that these blades could parry one another and could cause repeated damage, strike after strike. As this did not meet the requirements for the project, it was abandoned, and the formulas sold through backchannels to recoup losses. One formula fell into the hands of wizgangs, where they quickly gained popularity for their showiness and the skill needed to maintain and wield one. Duels and motorcycle jousts with blazing energy have become the new fad among these Awakened youths. Shadowrunners and assassins with a talent for swordplay may appreciate the blades for their additional damage potential, as well as the ability to summon a blade anywhere without trying to smuggle it into a secure location.

A Powerblade operates on the same principle as a Powerbolt or Powerball, affecting physical objects, capable of parrying and resisted by armor. A Manablade works like a Manabolt or Manaball, bypassing armor and capable of affecting spirits, but unable to parry physical attacks or damage objects. Note that weapon foci are able to parry Spellblades of either type due to their magically active nature. Spellblades can only be used by the person who casts them; they cannot be cast for anyone else to use. The range of the spell, then, is limited to the caster, though the spell can affect anything it touches once cast.

The damage for the weapons created by this spell equals to the Force plus the net hits rolled on the melee weapon skill of the wielder’s choice. (In spite of the name, the Clubs or Blades skill works equally well). The Accuracy of the Spellblade is equal to the Force of the spell, and the Reach is 1.
