| Skill Pilot Walker Style Quadruped |  |
| This is a four-legged “bug” crawler drone that is hard to tell from a natural insect at a glance. It’s ideal for penetrating confined areas, and its gecko-tipped extremities and light weight render it capable of crawling on walls and ceilings; it is, however, quite fragile, and merely being stepped on or a tag eraser can easily destroy it. This drone is operated with the Pilot Walker skill. |

## Silkorsky-Bell Microskimmer

| Skill Pilot Groundcraft (Hovercraft) Style Disc |  |
| Quiet and durable, this disc-shaped skimmer is smaller than a frisbee and can even skim over water. It moves with small and rather weak hoverjets. It is easier to spot than the Kanmushi, but still very small. It is operated with the Pilot Groundcraft skill; the hovercraft specialization applies. |
