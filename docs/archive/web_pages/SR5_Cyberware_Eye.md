Probably the most common piece of cyberware available in 2075 is cybereyes. Or iginally designed to gif t the blind with normal sight, cybereyes allow for far more than normal human vision. While they still carry a social stigma in places, and the idea continues to carry a degree of squeamishness about it, it ’s not entirely uncommon for people with per fectly good natural eyes to trade them out for cybernetic replacements. Cybereyes are available in any shape or color, from “almost natural” to all chrome to solid glowing purple and ever ything in between. Some models have their color and pattern easily altered by downloading a new skin.

Most cybereye modifications are also offered as retinal modifications to the natural eye. Vision enhancements either take up Capacity in cybereyes or Essence in natural eyes, not both. As a general rule, upgrades are applied to both eyes so that the user’s vision doesn’t become unbalanced.

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST    | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ------ |
| 0.5     | 16       | 12    | 14,000¥ | Core   |

| | |
| The basic cybereyes system features 20/20 vision for both eyes, an image link, and a built-in camera at no extra cost, as well as capacity for vision enhancements. |

## Flare Compensation

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.1     | [1]      | 4     | 1,000¥ | Core   |

| | |
| An implanted version of the flare compensation enhancement. This protects you from blinding flashes of light as well as simple glare. It mitigates the vision modifiers for glare and reduces the penalty from flashing lights, like from a flash-pak. |

## Image Link

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.1     | \*       | 4     | 1,000¥ | Core   |

| No Purchase Included in the basic cybereyes system. | |
| An implanted version of the image link enhancement. A standard upgrade, this lets you display visual information (text, pictures, movies, the current time, etc.) in your field of vision. This is usually AROs, but you can display pretty much whatever you want on it. You and your team can use it to share tactical and situational info in real time. An image link is what you need to truly “see” AR and participate in the modern world. |

## Low-Light Vision

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.1     | [2]      | 4     | 1,500¥ | Core   |

| | |
| An implanted version of the low-light vision enhancement. This accessory allows you to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. It doesn’t help in total darkness, though. |

## Ocular Drone

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| -       | [6]      | 6     | 6,000¥ | Core   |

| Remove Drone -3 Dice Pool to All Tasks | |
| This enhancement only affects one eyeball per purchase. A small spyball drone is placed in your ocular cavity. The spyball functions as a normal cybereye (with all the relevant enhancements) until you remove it and control it as though it were a Horizon Flying Eye . When it’s out and you have only one eye, you suffer a –3 dice pool penalty to all tasks. If you replace both eyes with drones, you’re effectively blind while those drones are operating apart from you. An ocular drone is obviously not available as a retinal modification. |

## Retinal Duplication (R 1–6)

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| | |
| This highly illegal modification can be loaded with a recording of someone else’s retina to create an almost perfect reproduction. Make an Opposed Test between the retinal duplication Rating and the retinal scanner Rating (Security Devices, p. 362). |

## Smartlink

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.2     | [3]      | 8R    | 4,000¥ | Core   |

| | |
| An implanted version of the smartlink vision enhancement (p. 444). Note that a smartlink installed in a natural eye or in a pair of cybereyes is more effective than a smartlink installed in an external device: see Smartgun System, p. 444. |

## Thermographic Vision

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

## Additional Eye Mount

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |

| | With the unusual SURGE effects in India often resulting in a third eye in the middle of the forehead, quite a few have gotten an eye mount in a similar way, leaving this “third eye” closed unless needed. While the third eye is cybernetic, the user normally retains their original eyes. This trend is starting to be picked up by Horizon. Dr. Spin |
| Ever wanted eyes in the back of your head? Well, now you can! Each additional eye mount allows the user to attach a cybereye to any part of their body that they wish. Due to the disorienting nature of such extra eyes, the user has a cumulative penalty of –1 to their Physical limit, and all weapon Accuracies, for each eye active beyond two. (A user can close one normal eye and use an additional eye mount as the second without penalty, or close both natural eyes and use two additional eye mounts as well.) Placement of this additional eye can provide tactical advantages for the cunning shadowrunner. The most common placement is one in the back of the head, to be aware of ambushes, or to a hand, allowing someone to look around corners. The listed cost is for the mount; the cybereye itself is sold separately. Using one eye in front and one in back grants +2 dice to Surprise tests. |

## Eye-light System

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 0.1     | [2]      | 2     | 500¥ | SR5:CF |

| | |
| The eye light system involves a pair of minuscule, high-power but low-heat lights installed into the user’s cybereyes. The mechanism is attached to the forward inner wall of the eye, with a second, smaller pupil installed to allow it to shine out. The light has a range of two meters and allows for a person with low-light vision to see for a range ten times that. The thin beam illuminates an area roughly the size of a sheet of paper or half a fuse box, allowing for a wide range of activities while leaving the hands completely free. Standard white light may be replaced by any other color, or ultraviolet, at no additional cost, with red being the most popular alternative. **Wireless bonus:** Activating or deactivating the eye light system is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action. |

## Eye Protectors

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 0.1     | [2]      | -     | 100¥ | SR5:CF |

| | |
| These are simple protective covers that go over the user’s eyes, preventing them from being harmed by dust and debris. They’re available in a wide array of color and style, as well as in plastic (Armor 3, just for the eyes) or ballistic glass (Armor 6, just for the eyes). |

## Microscopic Lenses

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.2     | [3]      | 4     | 1,000¥ | SR5:CF |

| | |
| Take your lab with you, but don’t forget your slides! Microscopic lenses allow for refocusing of the eye to a massive magnification of tiny, tiny objects, up to 1000X their normal size. When microscopic lenses are active, the user’s eye is unsuitable for any other task, but a Simple Action allows the lens to be switched on or off. An item further away than 30 centimeters is beyond the focal ability of active microscopic lenses. When microscopic lenses are being used, in addition to the obvious use, they provide a +4 dice pool bonus on Perception tests to examine the material in question. **Wireless Bonus:** Switching lenses on or off is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action. |

## Spider Eyes

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 0.2     | 2        | 8     | 2,000¥ | SR5:CF |

| | |
| Primitive eye clusters may be installed as an alternative to a third (or fourth, fifth, etc.!) eye. These simple eyes have poor detail and little color, but they discern light and darkness and, more importantly, movement. By placing these along the rear of the user’s head or neck, they can detect something approaching and react accordingly, without the distraction that a full visual sensory input would bring from a full eye. Note that Spider Eyes are cybereyes, not cybereye modifications! Users with spider eyes receive a +1 dice pool bonus on Surprise tests if the surprise is within 10 meters of them. |

### Targeting Laser (Infrared)

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |

| | |
| This is a large visible-dot laser (available in your choice of color) built into the user’s trigger hand, allowing it to act as a laser sight for all carried ranged weapons without using a top mount. As per a standard laser sight, this increases the weapon’s accuracy by 1 and is incompatible with smartgun modifiers. For people with infravision capabilities, an IR version is available so that your targeting activities are not overly obvious. **Wireless Bonus:** The targeting laser provides a +1 dice pool bonus on attack tests, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. Also, activating or deactivating the targeting laser is a Free Action instead of a Simple Action. |
