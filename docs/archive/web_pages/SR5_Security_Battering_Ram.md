Sometimes, when a maglock pass key or a lock pick just can’t get the job done, a more robust method becomes necessary. Popular with entry teams, battering rams range from hunks of metal to high-tech wireless devices. Battering rams are not recommended for use as a melee weapon but can be used as such (use Exotic Melee Weapon (Battering Rams) skill, assuming you had the foresight to select it). For normal use, battering rams require Strength + Agility for the attack test (see Destroying Barriers, p.197, SR5), which is added to the damage and then resisted by the object’s Body + Armor.

A metal tube weighing approximately 20 kilograms with a blunted end and handles along the sides, this is a no-frills entry tool that relies on the user’s Strength for breaching. The standard ram is normally used by one individual, but heavier versions are available and can be used by two average humans.

## Fluid-Motion Ram

The same as the standard battering ram, but it includes an internal ten-liter liquid reservoir. When used, the ram is swung backwards and then forward to strike the target. On impact the internal fluid in the ram creates extra momentum that increases the impact damage. Very useful against more durable doors, but using it requires two average-size humans or one average-size troll.

- Strength Rating to be used is (combined Strength of all users)/(number of users)

## Pneumatic Ram

Also known as the P-Ram, a pneumatic ram’s breaching power comes from a large, battery-powered pneumatic piston. A P-Ram is too large and heave to be swung. The quad-legged device is securely positioned at the door or barrier before operation and triggered by a touch pad or wirelessly. Its power comes at the expense of mobility; it requires a four-person team of average humans to deploy.

## Shock Ram

Users call it the Shock Knocker. It’s a shock ram is designed to disable electronic locks or defenses when it breaches a door or barrier. Four large conductive spikes protrude from the ram’s head that penetrates the barrier to deliver the charge. A metahuman in contact with the barrier or the spikes must resist shock damage per normal rules. Shock rams can be wirelessly discharged. Though an effective breaching tool, a shock ram requires frequent maintenance and constant monitoring, as repeated use can damage the mechanism and insulating protective casing. A glitch on a use test results in the batteries failing; a critical glitch results in a shock to the operator.
