The AK-97 is a legendary weapon with storied reliability—you can bury it for ten years, dig it up, and fire it immediately without a single problem. When all of the nano-fabricated AK–174s melted to slag, the AK-97s kept functioning just fine.

As Grenade

This rifle is an AK-97 with an integral under-barrel grenade launcher. Recently removed from the Russian inventory as it has largely been replaced by the AN-39, it is still being manufactured for export customers.

- I can provide bulk discounts, if any of you are interested.
  - Red Anya

- I know a couple of minor players who might be interested in a few cases each. Can you arrange shipping?
  - Picador

- I wouldn’t recommend this for serious work. The grenade launcher is too inaccurate for urban room clearing.
  - Hard Exit

- I find they work well enough when you use non-lethal chemical agents. Then again I try to minimize killing off potential future customers.

Grenade Launcher

Specially designed for Ares Firewatch special forces, the Alpha has since become a multi-platinum best-selling success the world over, seeing use with UCAS Special Forces. In part, this is due to its exceptional brand awareness, and also because of its underbarrel grenade launcher, smartgun system, and an expensive chamber design that provides 2 points of Recoil Compensation.

The longest continually produced member of Ares’ hyper velocity line, the HVAR is a complete small arms solution. It features an integral smartlink, a rigid stock with shock pad and a custom recoil reduction system, which is optimized for the weapon’s high rate of fire. Capable of accepting limited modification, the HVAR’s barrel is unable to support further additions.

- Spray and pray at its best. Or worst. I’ve never been that fond of the theory behind these weapons. They cause a tremendous logistics issue for field operations.
  - Picador

- I’ve found them effective is target-rich environments. The rifle lays down suppressive fire like nobody’s business, but unlike Picador I don’t play in jungles.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Bipod, Electronic Firing, Laser Sight, Melee Hardening

Colt’s latest entry into the para-military market, the Inception replaces the venerable M23 and asserts Colt’s continued dominance in new this lucrative market segment. The Inception comes with an integral bipod for long-range engagements, which only serves to further amplify its exceptional accuracy. The titanium alloy, reinforced polymer frame can withstand the impacts beyond those typical of a service weapon and remain functional. The Inception is a new way forward for Colt, another reason to Trust the Legend™.

- They sure like their catchphrase, don’t they? Of course, I’ve always found that the people who say “Trust me” the most are the ones that should be trusted the least.
  - Mika

- The bipod can be modified to work via PAN command pretty easily; the manufacturing process puts the frame supports in for those customers who purchase the “Intelli-Colt” package.
  - Slamm-0!

- Why would you be interested in a near-milspec rifle? From what I’ve heard, you generally avoid getting shot at.
  - Hard Exit

- They included it in the latest patch to Action Sniper™. I figured I should do some research on the real rifle before I made up my mind.

Refit Configuration
: XM30The XM30 takes an Automatics + Agility (5, 1 minute) Extended Test to refit to a new configuration. The Carbine uses the SMG range table.

As Grenade

The XM30 is H&K’s modular weapon system. Each kit comes with a shock-pad-equipped stock, smartgun system, imaging scope, two underbarrel secondary weapons, a secondary feed mechanism, and four different barrels along with a bipod for the heavy options. The XM30 is intended to equip entire military or police units with the ability to change roles based on the operational situation.

- I find them too complex for most of the runners who get them. The type of street sam who tends to shoot first seem to get confused with which option to use first.
  - Glitch

- I don’t have a problem with mine. It’s easier to stow a bag of parts than keep a half dozen full-sized rifle-caliber weapons properly stored.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Metahuman Customization, Melee Hardening, Imaging Scope (w/ Vision Enhancement 1, Vision Magnification)

A veteran of the Kilamanjaro cleansing, the Kriegfaust was designed to equip the larger members of a military command with a robust weapon suited to their needs. The drum magazine is better suited to larger hands and less likely to be dropped in high-adrenaline situations. The Kriegfaust also has a frame-mounted imaging scope, to ensure the shooter is able to get the maximum ballistic performance from the weapon’s large-caliber rounds.

- I’d be impressed if the ad didn’t read like a Humanis “You’re too stupid to own a gun” brochure. Not every one of us needs to have reinforced weapons just to carry them. You treat them with respect and they don’t fail you when needed.
  - Mihoshi Oni

- Personally, I was impressed with some of the marketing campaign. The whole “War Fist” ad series struck a chord with some of the ork population and spawned a children’s cartoon series, ensuring the weapon will have at least a low-rate, long-term production as the youth become preconditioned to wanting one.
  - Dr. Spin

- Don’t look now, but the Greek Minotaur Legion just gave it their official “Battle-Training Approved” endorsement. Whichever bureaucrat thought of using a government-backed military unit as a quality endorsement facility was a genius.

The standard weapon of the Imperial Japanese military, the Optimum II is getting a long in the tooth. The
weapon gained mass-media fame with General Saito’s troop’s performance in San Francisco. It has a recoil-absorbing shock pad and a smartgun system.

- Japan has announced a competition to replace the Optimum II, and Nissan wasn’t even offered a tender.
  - Baka Dabora

- Using the shotgun to open doors is an effective technique in close quarter combat. It also works well when the bounty decides to hunker down waiting for back up.
  - Sticks

- I’m more interested in where the rifles will end up once Japan starts to dispose of them.
  - Red Anya

- I’ve heard Shiawase has the inside track on the new contract. The Fatal Light is popular with the generals, and I’m sure the future work opportunities don’t hurt either.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Vintage

A footnote of Euro War history, the SBD-44 was a hastily constructed weapon developed to equip Germany’s equally hastily raised panzer grenadier units. Inspired by a weapon developed for equally desperate times and updated to fire modern ammunition, the SBd-44 was primarily constructed with a focus on quantity rather than the accuracy or quality typically associated with German manufactured items. The weapon was also rapidly phased out of production following the Alliance’s disintegration, making original production run versions rare today. Krupp still offers the weapon in their corporate security catalog, but no known orders have been processed in nearly twenty years.

- I’ve seen a few of these over the years; they were largely melted down after the war. I can sell one for far more to a collector than I’ll ever get on the street.
  - Red Anya

- I’ve fired one, once. I’m not sure what I hated more—the rattle from the upper/lower receiver joint or how flimsy the pistol grip felt. I could barely keep it on the target on semi-automatic. Everything seemed just a little off.
  - Marcos

- The new nano-manufacturing capabilities largely took over the immediate demand for these weapons, the AK-147 is in some ways the direct descendent of this design. It also reduced the prices on stamped metal manufacturing shops, like the ones originally used to produce the SBd-44.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Smartlink, Electronic Firing, Melee Hardening

The latest addition to Shiawase’s “Magazine Barrel” line, the Monsoon is a soldier’s dream, with the ammunition contained within the barrels. The Monsoon resists the environment’s harshest conditions and remains nearly maintenance free. As long as the user simply needs to ensure the barrels are not heavily plugged up and the bullets will fly toward their intended target, aided by the integral smartlink system, which is protected in its own shock-proof housing.

- The metal storm concept seems good in theory, but carrying extra barrels in the field must be a pain.
  - Hard Exit

- While I have no idea how tough it is for the rifle version, I find carrying spare barrels for the Fubuki no problem, as they are short enough to be tucked anywhere.
  - Kat o' Nine Tales

- I’ve seen a rigger use one of these on a flying drone. She carried the 43cm spare barrels in his van, with a roof-mounted landing pad for quick changes. I’m not sure how it would work in a manpacked arrangement, but it worked for her.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Imaging Scope (w/ flare compensation, image link, low-light vision), Retractable Stock

The Ultimax Rain Forest is a short-barreled rifle designed to meet a design requirement for the Sumatran Alliance. The weapon met all of the government’s criteria and has been purchased to equip the constabulary. The Rain Forest features a deep magazine well to protect the magazine from the moisture and dirt common in jungle climates. Integrating night-vision technology, the carbine is well adapted to operations under the double and triple canopies frequently encountered by users. The carbine is available through Matrix purchases as well as local retailers.

- Why would a government pay for the development of a service rifle without automatic fire capability? It’s not like they’ll make it illegal for themselves to own them.
  - /dev/grrl

- As part of the development contract and sales agreement, Ultimax was required to offer the carbine in a minimum of three different major civilian markets. Full-auto capability would have made it illegal in too many places. Apparently the Sumatran Alliance wanted to spread out the development costs to citizens of other countries to reduce their costs.
  - Mr. Bonds

- They used a large-caliber round and a short barrel, a bad combination for most applications. It has nearly as much muzzle flash as knockdown power.
  - Marcos

- They were right about the scope being useful under the canopy though. I saw a few teams use one as an ambush stopper.

This electronic-firing assault rifle is state-of-the-art. The Raiden is very accurate and is quickly being adopted by japanacorp security forces and the Japanese Imperial Marines. It features an integral sound suppressor and smartgun system, and the electronic firing mechanism and design provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation.
