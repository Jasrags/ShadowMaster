Tasers are legal to carry and a great choice for non-lethally incapacitating someone. Tasers, like other electrical weapons, have a flat Armor Penetration value of –5 and deal **[electricity damage](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage#Electricity_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**. Use the Pistols skill to fire a taser. Tasers can take only top-mounted accessories.

Standard Upgrade
: Laser Sight

Wireless
: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

A reliable self-defense weapon, this taser forgoes some wattage in each dart for a larger ammunition capacity, and backs that up with a top-mounted laser for increased accuracy for a less skilled shooter. It still looks sufficiently enough like a pistol to still intimidate targets who might scoff at a mere taser.

- This one will give someone my size just a tingle.

Wireless
: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

This heavy-duty taser fires up to 4 darts that trail wires up to 20 meters long. The wired connection to the battery allows for a more powerful shock. Most modern tasers use wireless darts, so the Defiance EX Shocker is an exception. It also features contacts that allow it to be used as a stun weapon in melee.

Standard Upgrades
: Laser Sight
: Gecko Grip

Wireless
: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

A sleek taser designed to accessorize well with women’s fashions, with the added benefit of geckogrip to allow it to be set anywhere that is comfortable on the body and a sleek top-mounted laser sight for quick targeting. This is a perfect choice to go with the immortal little black dress, stored under the dashboard of a car, or put next to the bed for a good night’s sleep.

Wireless
: A successful hit informs you of the status of the target’s basic health (and Condition Monitors).

The darts of this taser contain wireless capacitors, meaning that the Pulsar eliminates the need for cumbersome wires. As a trade-off, it is slightly less powerful than the EX Shocker, although it can fire faster. It lacks the EX Shocker’s melee contacts.
