A recent experimental prototype “laser shotgun” produced by Ares, this laser weapon uses a beam splitter to fre an array of smaller lasers rather than a single cohesive beam. This weapon has been seen in limited use with Firewatch teams but has not been released for sale on the military arms market. If you are lucky enough to happen across one for sale, consider its condition to be dropped once, never fired. This weapon has the same qualities specifc to other laser weapons (p. 47, Run & Gun) including increased range penalties and power source needs. The Armatus uses shotgun ranges and can fire narrow, medium, or wide spreads like a normal shotgun.

This popular non-lethal weapon fires DMSO gel packs. The dimethyl sulfoxide forces the skin to absorb the chemicals the operator wishes to deliver. The attack itself causes no damage, but when the target is hit successfully, the DMSO delivers the substance directly into the target’s bloodstream as a Contact vector toxin (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs, p. 408). The Super Squirt uses Light Pistol ranges and can accept top- and underbarrel-mounted accessories

Sonic Rifle
: The sonic rifle can fire with variable beam settings. It uses the same rules as shotguns (p. 180, SR5) for determining the number of targets affected and the DV modifier, as well as ranges. The Exotic Ranged Weapon (Sonic Rifle) skill is used to fire this weapon.

Damage Resistance
: The Damage Resistance Test uses Willpower instead of Body and ignores all standard armor. Damper earware (p. 454, SR5) provides +2 bonus dice to the resistance test. A Hush or Silence spell reduces the DV by –1 per hit on the Spellcasting Test.

Conditions
: Targets hit by a beam suffer the effects of disorientation and nausea (see p. 409, SR5, use Damage Resistance Test in place of Toxin Test). The rifle uses peak discharge battery packs, with each shot consuming 1 power unit.

This is a nasty little oddball of a weapon. Though it’s called the Screech and its classified as a sonic rifle, anyone with this thing pointed at them will rarely hear a thing other then their own retching as they puke up their latest meal. This devious invention uses focused sound waves to disorient the target while not causing any real damage. Perfect for crowd control as long as the users are prepped with gas masks, since the reek of soybase vomit will fill the air this sucker is fired.

- Don’t try and use this against spirits. Their lack of a standard biology makes them immune to the effect. Works great on most other things though. Usually seems to depend on whether they have ears that affect their balance and equilibrium.

## Fichetti Pain Inducer

Wireless
: The Pain Inducer recharges by induction at a rate of 1 charge per hour.

For a non-lethal weapon, the Fichetti Pain Inducer is not very humane. It makes someone feel like they are in a microwave, roasting from the inside out. Treat this as a toxin attack with a Power of 8 and a speed of Immediate. The target resists with Body + Willpower. If the modified Power exceeds the target’s Mental limit, the target must spend his next Action Phase doing whatever it takes to run away from the pain. The attacker can continue to hold her beam on a target with a Complex Action unless the game-master deems the target has dodged away or found cover. If the target cannot get out of the beam, he is incapacitated with pain, suffering a dice pool modifier equal to the modified Power on all tests for as long as the beam is trained on him.

The Pain Inducer uses SMG ranges and can take top and underbarrel accessories. It has ten charges; when attached to a power point, it reloads one charge every ten seconds.
Wireless: The Pain Inducer recharges by induction at a rate of 1 charge per hour.

| 5 | 10P | -2 | SA | – | 10(c) | 12F | 2,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

Accessories
: The FN-AAL Gyrojet pistol can mount the same accessories as a heavy pistol and uses the same ranges.

Aquatic Use
: When it is used underwater, increase the standard munitions DV ratings by +2 in addition to any other modifiers.

Once advertised as a favorite of the British Special Boat Squadron, FN has increased their market audience to most of the marine-based special operations forces around the world. The gun fires miniature 6mm rockets that explode on impact—an effect that, underwater, is even worse than in the air.

- FN makes a full array of alternate munitions that match up well with their standard counterparts. Jelly rockets are awesome.

Gun Cane
: The gun cane uses taser ranges, can only use caseless ammo, and cannot mount any accessories. It is fired with the Exotic Ranged Weapons (Gun Cane) skill.

Concealment
: Its Concealment modifiers are +0 for the whole cane and –6 to detect its true nature (see p. 419, SR5).

Where fashion meets defense, this single-shot weapon is a fashion accessory with both form and function. Designed to look just like Mortimer’s regular line of dress canes, the Trafalger tag goes on any of the gun canes no matter what they look like.

Originally designed to non-lethally take down large game animals at long ranges, the Parashield dart rifle uses compressed air cartridges to fire injection darts. This weapon includes a top-mounted imaging scope. It uses sporting rifle ranges and can mount top and underbarrel accessories.

Combining the best of offense and defense, this set of forearm guards (p. 73, Run & Gun) offers +1 Armor and has a built in light pistol “Magazine Barrel” on the dominant arm’s guard. Firing is a Complex Action. The magazine barrel holds 6 shots that can be fred individually or all at once as full auto fire. The Simoom uses pistol ranges. Full Auto fire takes a –2 penalty from recoil. The offhand guard has one capacity slot that stores a spare barrel magazine (nonfring) standard but can be repurposed with other equipment. The Concelability modifer to hide the true function of the bracer is –4. Wireless bonus: Firing is a Simple Action

Shooting Bracer
: The Élégance Shooting Bracer can only use caseless ammunition and uses taser ranges. It cannot mount any accessories.

Concealability
: The bracer’s Concealability modifier to hide its true function is –5 (see p. 419, SR5).

Elegant and deadly in one high fashion package. Tiffani has made the Élégance for years, and dozens of basic designs are out there now. The truly elite get their bracers customized to match their newest fashions, and some have gathered quite the collection of Élégance bracers in their closet.

- Aim on these things is wretched due to the lack of barrel. Tiffani has tried to help make up for that with a laser sight feature available on their newest model.
