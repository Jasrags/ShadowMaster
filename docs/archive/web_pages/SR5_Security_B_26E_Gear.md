| The keycard copier allows the user to copy a (stolen) keycard in seconds. A new keycard can then be manufactured with a Hardware kit, about ten minutes, and a Hardware + Logic [Mental] (2) Test. When used, the forged keycard uses its Rating x 2 in an Opposed Test against the Maglock Rating x 2 (see Maglocks ). Some security systems may note the unusual usage of duplicate keys, like when “Dr. Scientist” accesses a lab that she just accessed and hasn’t left yet. |

This portable device creates a small electric arc to melt metals, either to cut through metal or to weld it together. Its power supply allows it to operate for 30 minutes. While creating an intense heat, the arc is much too small to make a good weapon (it would be like trying to stab someone with a lighter). The miniwelder has a Damage Value of 25 when used to cut through barriers.

The top of each chain segment on this portable motorized saw is covered with monofilament wire. Ideal for cutting through trees, doors, and other immovable objects. A monofilament chainsaw is too unwieldy to make a good melee weapon (use Exotic Melee Weapon skill). When used against barriers, double the monofilament chainsaw’s Damage Value of 8P.
