These weapons are primarily muscle-powered, although some might use simple mechanical assistance for added distance or speed (see Projectiles, p. 181).

- The Shark has enough force that “fishermen” aren’t limited to standard fishing line. This model pops off with enough power to pull spidersilk cable or other heavier test.

Not quite the wrist rocket you had as a kid—if David had the Giantslayer, the end result of his little tiff with Goliath wouldn’t be quite so startling. Modern materials throughout make this “kid’s toy” as deadly as any holdout and most light pistols on the market.

- The slingshot, whether this Ares model or something more mundane, is great for delivering a variety of ordnance. Most people think marbles or ball bearings and occasionally capsule rounds, but sticky RFID trackers and even a little sticky explosive charge are a few of the more creative uses of the slingshot.

| 6 | (Rating + 2)P | –(Rating / 4) | – | – | – | Rating | Rating x 100¥ | Core |

Max Rating
: 10

Strength Minimum
: If Strength is less than Rating then -3 DP per point below Rating.

Damage Rating
: Lowest value of Strength, Bows Rating, or Arrow Rating.

Range Rating
: Lowest value of Strength, Bows Rating, or Arrow Rating.

Reload
: Simple Action

This could be a traditional longbow of fiberglass or wood, or possibly a modern compound-and-pulley bow. Both are archaic and rare weapons on the streets of 2075, and both have the advantage of being hacker-proof. Reloading a bow takes a Simple Action (Ready Weapon, p. 165). Bows have ratings that indicate the minimum Strength you need to use that weapon. When attacking with a bow, a character whose Strength is less than the Rating suffers a –3 dice pool modifier per point below the minimum; this penalty reflects the difficulty they have in pulling the bow and nocking an arrow. Use the lowest value of your Strength, the bow’s rating, or the arrow Rating for range and damage when attacking a target, because your average Rating 10 titanium-sheathed beryllium-alloy bow tends to turn wood or fiberglass arrows into powder when they hit a target.

For most people, their Strength is a fixed factor. For those with magic on their side, Strength can vary dramatically. For archers that like to pump themselves up magically, a compound bow was developed with dynamic pulley adjustment that allows a variable draw strength. This bow functions similarly to a compound bow, but the Rating can be changed from 1 through 10 as a Simple Action.

Whether used to spear fish, defend against some of the more aggressive denizens of the oceans, or remind other sentient swimmers that what you’ve found beneath the waves belongs to you, the Aquadyne Shark can be a valuable asset. Powered by CO2 and possessing an internal magazine, the Shark doesn’t stop after just one pull of the trigger, a feature that has saved many a diver that trusted the Aquadyne brand. For the sport fisherman, the Shark features the QuickClip line system that makes setting up for the next catch faster than ever.

The Sliver, as well as some of its other competing models, is designed for stealthy operation as opposed to high-damage potential. Due to the preference for stealth over force, the Sliver is most often used with Ranger Puncture Injection Bolts. These supposedly “best in the market” projectiles offer significant penetrative power to make sure whatever they’re loaded with makes its way into the target.

- The Punctures are definitely better, but don’t forget that a bolt is really nothing but a short arrow, which means there are ones with interchangeable heads. Titan’s line of explosive and electric heads can help boost the potential of your little Sliver.
