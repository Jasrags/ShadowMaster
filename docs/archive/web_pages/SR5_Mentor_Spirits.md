In the search for magical enlightenment, affiliation, or purpose, many Awakened individuals are drawn toward certain animals, mythological figures, or concepts. This may be an idol they grew up with, a tribal totem, or something they look up to achieve in their life. It could also relate to their religious or magical beliefs. So strong are the feelings for this person or idea that once the individual Awakens, the idea takes a life on its own. It becomes what is known as a mentor spirit.

This mentor spirit is much like other spirits in that it has its own personality, but it’s not a spirit in the summon-and-banish sense of the term. It can be seen and heard by those it chooses, and even physically interact with its followers. Your mentor spirit can have significant influence over you, giving you benefits when you remain true or punishing you if you go astray (usually with temporary reductions to your Magic rating).

Magical mentorship can come in different forms. Often you have your own link to your mentor spirit, but an Awakened guild or society can become linked to a mentor spirit as a group.

There is no real understanding of the nature of mentor spirits, but their general goal is clear: They want to keep Awakened individuals on the path that helped introduce the mentor spirit to the Earth in the first place. For gamemasters, mentor spirits can be used as a tool to communicate information to the magician and enhance role-playing. The mentor spirit can provide cryptic clues, riddles, omens, and sometimes even straightforward advice. Any Awakened character can connect with
a mentor spirit by taking the Mentor Spirit quality (p. 76). Gamemasters may also choose to award mentor spirits in the course of role playing, provided the player character has done enough to deserve it.

## Adversary

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Chaos, Anarchy | SR5:HT |

Wherever there is cosmological order, there is an entity that wishes to overthrow it. The Adversary is the original rebel against the powers that be. Followers of the Adversary have serious issues with authority and conformity. Followers range from those dedicated to helping the underprivileged and abused (by “the man”) to the one who indulges his love of anarchy for its own sake. Free will and cynicism are the Adversary follower’s tools and trade.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 to demolition skill tests | Because of their deep-seated hatred for authority, a teammate’s use of leadership skill is counterproductive to followers of Adversary, invoking either a negative dice penalty or loss of initiative. If the plan doesn’t go the way that the adversary follower wants it to go, it takes a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test for him to get him to cooperate. |

## Alligator

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Crocodile, Sloth, Greed | SR5:HS |

A follower of the Gator mentor spirit feels at home in cities as well as swamps and rivers. Gator shamans are ill-tempered and lazy, expecting a larger share for the work he does—assuming you can get him to agree to do it. He is also a miser when it comes to having to pay for anything including meals and he’s a real big eater. The virtuous aspects of the gator magician is that he’s a strong fighter and will finish what he agrees to do. They may seem to be motionless, but once roused to action they are ferocious and nearly unstoppable.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 to Intimidation skill tests | A follower of the alligator is stubborn in changing plan or action after he has committed to it. When the rest of the team goes to plan B, the magician must succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to make the mental adjustment. Otherwise, they continue trying to execute plan A. |

## Arcana

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Gambler, Lady Luck | SR5:FA |

Arcana is not a traditional mentor spirit as such, but an interaction that its followers describe as an intimacy with the Tarot. Followers of the Arcana place their decisions and fates in the hands of the cards, as they believe that their destiny can be found there, along with great power. While the traditional mentor relationship isn't present, the influence of the Arcana is felt in more tangible ways. Those under the sway of Arcana are not just seers or fortune tellers, but believers in the will of magic itself. Of course, the will of the Tarot is always open to interpretation, and so adherents are not monolithic in their belief or practice. For its part, while Arcana might not speak with words, the cards are always present for guidance.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | Once per day, when making a decision or test influenced by a Tarot reading/card, may re-roll misses as if they used Edge. | Followers of the Arcana must use Tarot decks or individual cards as foci and fetishes, or else take -2 when attempting to use them. The Tarot Arcana plays such a major part in the lives of its adherents that when a follower of Arcana becomes a grade 1 initiate, they must choose centering or adept centering for their first benefit, with the cards of Tarot being the focus of their centering. |

## Bat

| --- | --- |
| Wanderer | SR5:HT |

Bat is well-traveled, rarely staying in one place. As a seeker, she sets far-reaching goals and gets restless when not moving. She is adaptable and can make herself at home anywhere. Magicians following Bat keep things light and portable for traveling.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 to Navigation Tests | A follower of Bat is easily distracted and becomes irritable during enforced inaction. She prefers spontaneity to routine. Every week that the magician stays in the same place, she takes a -1 penalty to all actions until she finds a new place to stay. Also, unless she succeeds in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test, she cannot enter a hangout (bar, club, restaurant) more than once in a week without suffering a -1 to all Magic tests for the next twenty-four hours. |

## Bear

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Strength, Protection | SR5 |

This mentor symbolizes strength and protection. He is a healer and cannot turn down those in need without good reason, and he defends those under his care. Bear is more than a gentle healer; he is a ferocious protector, disregarding his own safety in combat if wounded or if someone he is protecting is injured.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice for tests to resist damage (not including Drain) | You might go berserk when you take Physical damage in combat or if someone under your care is badly injured. Make a Simple Charisma + Willpower Test (wound modifiers apply). You go berserk for 3 turns minus 1 turn per hit, so 3 or more hits averts the berserk rage entirely. If you’re already going berserk, increase the duration. When you’re berserk, you go after your attacker(s) without regard for your own safety. If you incapacitate the target(s) before the time is up, the berserk fury dissipates. |

## Boar

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
|  | SR5:HS |

Followers of the Boar are static in their ways. They keep to a daily routine and hold on to their stuff till it wears away. Some people would call them boring or unspontaneous, others would call them hoarders. Followers believe themselves to be loyal to the places that are part of their routine, and they are very protective of their territory.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | Home Ground Quality is gained for free. | A follower of Boar does not like it if there are others intruding in his space or disrupting his routine. At best, the follower protects the bar and employees of the bar he always goes to. At worst, he will start a fight for a specific table or stool that he thinks is his. A warning is optional and usually proffered by the follower’s friends. It takes a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test for a follower of Boar to leave his home, safehouse, or routine permanently, otherwise he will keep coming back, even at the risk of his own safety. If the Boar does leave, he receives a –1 penalty to all active skill tests for three weeks until he finally settles into a new place and routine. |

| --- | --- |
| Warrior, Warmonger | SR5:SG |

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice pool modifier for Composure Tests | Berserker’s followers have very short fuses. Whenever someone strongly disagrees with you (gamemaster’s discretion), you must pass a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test to keep from striking out against the offender. If the test fails, the attack can be in any form you choose (fist, spell, etc.), but it must have the intent to cause damage. |
| Magician | +2 dice for Physical-type Combat spells, preparations, and rituals |

## Cat

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Mystery, Stealth | SR5 |

Cat is honored in cultures around the world. Cat is often seen as the guardian of mystical secrets, including those involving the afterlife. She certainly knows many secrets but rarely decides to share them, and never with anyone who is not worthy. She is stealthy, sly, and arrogant. Cat toys with her prey—threatening, taunting, and confusing her targets—rather than going directly for the kill.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice to either Gymnastics or Infiltration Tests (choose one) | Cat magicians toy with their prey. Unless you succeed in a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test at the start of combat, you cannot make an attack that incapacitates your target. If you take any Physical damage, all this playing around stops. |

## Chaos

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
| Trickster, Troublemaker | SR5:SG |

Adherents of Chaos seemingly do things at random and love to start arguments or barroom brawls just for kicks, often through random trickery. While most people have a rather fixed sense of right and wrong, a Chaos follower’s moral compass points in a different direction from moment to moment.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice pool modifier for Con Tests | You are an inveterate gossip trying to stir up trouble, especially between friends, and thus cannot keep damaging secrets to yourself. Also, anytime you encounter a public situation deemed too quiet or stable (gamemaster’s discretion), make a Willpower + Intuition (3) Test. Failure means that you are compelled to stir the pot in any way you desire, be it attacking, telling lies, or throwing a drink on someone nearby. |

## Dolphin

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
|  | SR5:HS |

Followers of Dolphin are graceful, free-spirited characters who enjoy playful banter and have to move when music plays. They see things optimistically and believe there is good in the world despite current conditions of corporate politics and pollution. They are not naïve—at least, they don’t believe they are. They just have faith in humanity. Somehow.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice on Artisan skill tests or Pilot (Watercraft) skill tests (choose one) | Followers are altruistic when it comes to helping people and cannot turn a blind eye to those who they believe deserve their help. It is difficult for them not to get involved when they see someone being bullied or obviously polluting the environment. If they see such a situation, it takes a Charisma + Willpower (3) Test for a follower of Dolphin not to intervene. If the job that the follower of Dolphin is on involves polluting the environment or becoming the bully/enforcer on those less deserving, then the follower loses 2 dice after each such deed until she atones. Atonement is up to the gamemaster but can involve time and money spent with charities. |

This most heroic of mentor spirits is also the most fun loving. Though he fights to protect his own against all dangers, he loves a good party even more. He is a big brother who takes a friendly interest in everything his family does. Though sometimes naïve, he makes a staunch friend and a deadly enemy. The dragons he slays have changed with the times: current beasts include crime, pollution, corruption, and of course, actual dragons. Dragonslayer fights hard and plays hard. Once he has given his oath, he never breaks it. A Dragonslayer magician behaves with honor and respect, and demands the same from those around him.

Fire-Bringers devote themselves to the betterment of others, even at their own expense. Most followers of Fire-Bringer throw themselves into a particular cause with great zeal.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |

## Horse

| SIMILAR ARCHETYPES | SOURCE |
| --- | --- |
|  | SR5:HS |

Followers of the Horse mentor spirit are the embodiment of freedom. They must be out in the open air and allowed to roam the open road. Followers are never intentionally stubborn or malicious, but they do not like to feel impeded or confined by someone else. This unfortunately also means that followers of Horse may sacrifice personal relationships for freedom.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice to Running or Pilot Ground Craft) tests (choose one) | Followers of the Horse can’t sit still for long nor be confined indoors.

| --- | --- |
| Endurance, Stubbornness | SR5 |

Mountain is rooted in the very heart of the Earth but reaches toward lofty heights. She has limitless strength and endurance, but Mountain’s inflexible nature limits her. Mountain is a stubborn and unyielding force, and Mountain magicians are difficult to persuade once they have made up their minds about something.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |

Completion of the Extended Test does not necessarily mean you found the answer, but it at least silences the question in your mind for the time being. When a follower of Oracle becomes a Grade 1 initiate (p. 324, SR5), she must choose Divination (p. 147) for her first metamagic rather than a Power Point or any other benefit. |

|  | SR5:HS |

Spider likes to feel a connection to everything. To be at the center of a web connecting all sorts of news and able to feel the pulse of the world. Followers of Spider like to be in the know, establishing connections, be it directly with people or through surveillance. Some may feel that followers of Spider are nothing more than Awakened bloggers who scan the Matrix for tidbits of the truth.

| ADVANTAGES | DISADVANTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| All | +2 dice to Computer skill tests | Followers of Spider are already paranoid about people having any misconceptions about them being insect shamans. They will keep such details from casual conversation. Followers of Spider also have taken advantage of the Matrix more than more traditional shamas in creating connections. This makes followers more agoraphobic as they avoid uncontrolled social situations and unfamiliar environments. They receive a –1 dice pool modifier to Magic tests while out in the open (this includes very large indoor rooms such as auditoriums, theatres, and stadiums). The penalty doubles if there is a large crowd of people to deal with. |
