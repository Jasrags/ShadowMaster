Detection spells give the subject a new sense (beyond the normal five) or improve a sense the subject already has, for as long as they are sustained. Detection spells may be cast upon yourself or on another subject within touch range. The standard range of the sense a Detection spell grants is the spell’s Force x caster’s Magic in meters as a radius from the target of the spell. Extended-range detection spells have a Force x Magic x 10 meter range. The more net hits you get when casting the spell, the more detailed information you receive.Using the extra or enhanced sense may require the subject to Observe in Detail as a Simple Action. Detection spells are either directional (like normal sight), area effect (work in all directions at once, like hearing), or psychic (providing some other special sense such as telepathy or precognition).

The sense is either active, requiring special efforts or actions to use, or passive, meaning it enhances the abilities of those affected without them having to take separate actions.

Active
: Active detection spells involve an Opposed Test between the caster’s Spellcasting + Magic [Force] and either Willpower + Logic (+ Counterspelling if available) [Mental] for living things with auras, (Force x 2) for magical objects, or the object resistance for mundane objects (p. 295). Counterspelling may be used to defend against active detection spells, even if the target is unaware of them being cast (for example, if they walk within range of an active Detect Enemies spell).
: When a spell affects multiple targets, either because it has an area effect or because it is sustained and may be encountered by multiple people, you should only make a single Spellcasting Test. Every potential target then makes an individual Spell Resistance Test and compares their result to yours. New targets may be detected as they enter the range of the spell, and they must make a Spell Resistance Test against your original Spellcasting Test.

Passive
: A passive sense is simply “on” and feeds sensory input to the subject’s brain like other senses—no interpretation necessary. While the spell is sustained, Perception Tests using this sense have a limit equal to the net successes from casting of the spell instead of the subject’s Mental limit. Counterspelling cannot be used to defend against a passive sense, but once an opposing spellcaster realizes there is an active sustained spell, she can try dispelling it (see Dispelling, p. 295).

Glitches
: A glitch on a Detection Spellcasting Test may result in false or misleading information. Likewise, a critical glitch may inflict extra Drain (e.g., +2 Drain Value), translate any Drain damage suffered into Physical Damage, temporarily strip the subject of a sense, or inexplicably apply the intended sense to others (particularly opponents) in range—hopefully they’ll remember to thank you for your help in spotting you and your team.

## Analyze Device

| ANALYZE DEVICE        |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose and operation of a device or piece of equipment within range of the sense. The casting of the spell is opposed by the object’s resistance (p. 295). Each net hit can be used to provide a piece of information about the device that would not be readily apparent (for example, it would not give the information that it is a Renraku-manufactured device if the thing is emblazoned with a huge Renraku logo, but it might say what the basic function of the thing is). Each net hit also gives the subject a bonus die while operating the device and allows the subject to ignore any skill-defaulting modifiers for using it as long as the spell is sustained.

## Analyze Magic

| ANALYZE MAGIC         |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** P           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

This spell allows the subject to analyze the purpose of a magical object (e.g., foci, alchemical preparations, magical lodges, active rituals). Treat the net hits from the Spellcasting Test as hits on the Assensing Table (p. 313), except the subject isn’t required to be perceiving astrally.

## Analyze Truth

| ANALYZE TRUTH         |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

The subject can tell whether a target’s statements are the truth (or at least if the subject honestly believes them to be true).The spell needs at least 1 net hit to determine validity of a selected statement. The spell does not work on written materials or items recorded through any sort of technological medium. The subject must hear a statement in person (with the target within range) to be able to judge its truth.

## Clairaudience

| CLAIRAUDIENCE          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

The subject can hear distant sounds as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The listening point may be moved to any other point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. While using Clairaudience, the subject cannot use her normal hearing. This spell doesn’t translate visual images, only sounds (and only sounds within the subject’s natural range of hearing; augmented hearing does not apply).

## Clairvoyance

| CLAIRVOYANCE           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

The subject can see distant scenes as if physically present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. The visual point may be moved to any other point within range of the spell as a Complex Action. The subject can’t use normal vision or astral perception while using Clairvoyance. This spell doesn’t translate sound, only vision, and it doesn’t work with augmented vision. You can’t target spells through Clairvoyance.

## Combat Sense

| COMBAT SENSE       |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| (PASSIVE, PSYCHIC) |
| **Type:** M        | **Range:** T | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S    | **Drain:** F | **Source:** Core |

The subject can subconsciously analyze combat and other dangerous situations within range, sensing events a split-second before they happen. Every hit on the Spellcasting Test adds 1 die for Reaction on Surprise Tests, and also to rolls made when defending against ranged and melee attacks as long as the spell remains in effect.

## Detect Enemies, Detect Enemies Extended

| DETECT ENEMIES  |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

| DETECT ENEMIES, EXTENDED |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)  |
| **Type:** M              | **Range:** T | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S          | **Drain:** F | **Source:** Core |

The subject can detect living targets within range who have hostile intentions toward him. The spell does not detect traps (since they aren’t alive), nor can it detect someone about to shoot into a crowd at random (since the hostility is not directed at the subject of the spell). The spell can detect targets preparing an ambush or other surprise attack directed at the subject.

## Detect Individual

| DETECT INDIVIDUAL |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)    |
| **Type:** M       | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S   | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

The subject can detect the presence of a particular individual anywhere within range of the sense. You need to specify the individual during casting, someone you know or at least have met in the past.

## Detect Life, Detect Life Extended

| DETECT LIFE     |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** Core |

| DETECT LIFE, EXTENDED   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA) |
| **Type:** M             | **Range:**       | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S         | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

The subject detects all living beings (but not spirits) within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. In a crowded area, the spell is virtually useless, picking up a blurred mass of traces of life.

## Detect Life Form, Detect Life Form Extended

| DETECT [LIFE FORM] |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)     |
| **Type:** M        | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S    | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

| DETECT [LIFE FORM], EXTENDED |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA)      |
| **Type:** M                  | **Range:** T | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S              | **Drain:** F | **Source:** Core |

The subject detects all of a specified type of life form within the range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. This is actually several different spells that must be learned separately, one for each type of life form that a caster might like to detect (Detect Orks, Detect Elves, Detect Dragons, and so forth), which are learned separately.

## Detect Magic, Detect Magic Extended

| DETECT MAGIC    |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

| DETECT MAGIC, EXTENDED  |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, EXTENDED AREA) |
| **Type:** M             | **Range:** T | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S         | **Drain:** F | **Source:** Core |

The subject can detect the presence of all foci, spells, wards, magical lodges, alchemical preparations, active rituals, and spirits within range of the sense. It does not detect Awakened characters or critters, astral signatures, alchemical preparations that that have expired or already triggered, or the effects of permanent spells once they have become permanent.

## Detect Object

| DETECT [OBJECT] |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)  |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 2 | **Source:** Core |

The subject detects all of a specified type of object within range of the sense and knows their number and relative location. Each type of object requires a separate spell (Detect Guns, Detect Computers, Detect Explosives, and so forth). These spells must all be learned and cast separately.

## Mindlink

| MINDLINK          |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC) |
| **Type:** M       | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S   | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** Core |

Mindlink allows the magician and one voluntary subject to communicate mentally, exchanging conversation, emotions, and mental images. One hit on the Spellcasting Test is enough to establish the link. The subject must remain within range of the magician for the Mindlink to work.

## Mind Probe

| MIND PROBE            |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T | **Damage:**      |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F | **Source:** Core |

This spell allows the subject to telepathically probe the mind of a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). The target is aware of the probing, though they may not know the source of the spell. The number of net hits you get on the spell determines what kind of information the subject can read, given on the table. The subject may probe for one piece of information per Complex Action while the spell is sustained. Additional uses of Mind Probe against the same target within a number of hours equal to the target’s Willpower inflict a –2 dice pool modifier on the Spellcasting attempt.

**MIND PROBE TABLE**

| NET HITS | RESULTS                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1–2      | The subject can read the target’s surface thoughts only.                                                                                                                         |
| 3–4      | The subject can find out anything the target consciously knows and view the target’s recent memories (up to 72 hours).                                                           |
| 5+       | The subject can probe the target’s subconscious, gaining information the target may not even be consciously aware of, like psychological quirks, deep fears, or hidden memories. |

## Astral Message

| ASTRAL MESSAGE         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Astral Message used the principles of Astral Projection (p. 313, SR5) to send short verbal messages (one hundred words or less) through the astral plane without creating a watcher. The spellcaster must have personal experience with the target’s astral form or possess a material link (p. 296, SR5). The message will seek out the target and be delivered to her the next time she is present in the astral plane or if she summons a watcher (p. 313, SR5).

The message only lasts for a limited time. The minimum duration is twenty-four hours; this is extended by an extra twenty-four hours for each hit on the Spellcasting Test.

## Astral Clairvoyance

| ASTRAL CLAIRVOYANCE    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Astral Clairvoyance is a variant of the Clairvoyance spell (p. 286, SR5) designed to work in the astral plane. The subject may project her assensing ability as though she were astrally present at a chosen point within the sensory range of the spell. This “visual point” may be moved to any other location within the sensory range of the spell at will. During the spell, the subject’s normal assensing is overlaid with the insight gained from this spell. This has the unfortunate side effect of blocking out her natural physical senses.

Magicians cannot use Astral Clairvoyance to target others with spells.

## Borrow Sense, Animal Sense, Eyes of the Pack

| BORROW SENSE          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| ANIMAL SENSE          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 5 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| EYES OF THE PACK      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S       | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This collection of spells allows the spellcaster to tap into the senses of her target.

Borrow Sense enables the subject to borrow a single sense from a chosen target within range of the spell. If the target fails to resist the spell, the subject perceives with the target’s sense as if it were his own. Any Perception Tests made by the subject using the target’s sense use the caster’s net hits on the Spellcasting Test as the limit. Note that anything sensed by the target does not make a Spell Resistance Test. The caster must touch the subject while casting the spell. The target of Borrow Sense remains in control of his own actions and senses; the subject is merely along for the ride. The subject cannot communicate with the target or direct her to focus on anything specific. Nor may the subject leverage his own augmented senses (including astral sight) through the target’s senses. The subject cannot target spells through the target’s senses. As long as the caster sustains the spell, the subject can switch from one of the target’s senses to another with a Simple Action. Senses that the subject does not normally have can be borrowed (such as bat sonar). Note that a target’s astral sight is considered a separate sense for purposes of this spell (i.e., the subject can borrow sight or astral sight, but not both at the same time).

Animal Sense is a restricted version of Borrow Sense that can only be used to borrow a sense from a non-sapient, non-paranormal animal.

Eyes of the Pack is a variant of Borrow Sense that only works with voluntary targets and only allows the sense of sight to be borrowed. Switching from the sight of one member of “the pack” to another requires a Simple Action.

## Catalog

| CATALOG         |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, AREA)  |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T(A)  | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

By casting Catalog, the spellcaster mystically empowers the subject to compile a comprehensive, itemized list of all the non-living items within the area of the spell. The subject can write or dictate a list of the quantity of all items in range of the spell as long as the caster beats an item’s Object Resistance threshold (p. 295, SR5). Net hits obtained in the spellcasting indicate the level of detail and description the list provides.Items in the area that the subject would not recognize by sight are listed as “unknown.” The caster must touch the area targeted by the spell.

## Diagnose

| DIAGNOSE              |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M           | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** I       | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Diagnose grants the subject information on the target’s general health and any illnesses, injuries, or other mundane medical problems the target might possesses. The net hits determine the detailed level of the information provided, as noted on the Detection Spell Results table (p. 286, SR5). It provide more details than Assensing would at comparable hit levels. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.

## Dragon Astral Signature

| DRAGON ASTRAL SIGNATURE |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC, AREA) |
| **Type:** M             | **Range:** LOS (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S         | **Drain:** F + 5   | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Rumors suggest that this spell was developed by an S-K Prime operation monitoring dragon-hunter groups operating in Europe and Asia, and it has been leaked into the underground to test how the dragons will respond to this new threat. The caster gains the ability to assense the astral signatures of her local astral environment to determine if a dragon is present or if there is a touch of dragon magic on anything in the area (assuming the aura has not yet faded due to the passage of time).

## Enhance Aim

| ENHANCE AIM            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** P            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Enhance Aim magically improves a voluntary target’s natural ability to aim by reducing range modifiers against targets (similar to using image magnification; see p. 178, SR5). Each hit scored by the caster reduces the effective range for the shooter for the purpose of calculating Range modifiers by 10 meters. Unlike image magnification, the target does not need a Take Aim action to lock onto a target, as the spell does that auto-magically. The effect of Enhance Aim is cumulative with other targeting devices, implants, and abilities (laser sights, scopes, smartlinks, Improved Ability adept power, etc.). The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.

## Hawkeye

| HAWKEYE                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** P            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Hawkeye improves a voluntary subject’s visual acuity. Each hit scored by the caster provides a +1 dice pool modifier for visual Perception Tests. This effect is cumulative with other perception aids, implants, and abilities (vision enhancement, adept powers, etc.). The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.

## Mana Window, Astral Window

| MANA WINDOW           |

These spells are advanced versions of Clairvoyance (p. 286, SR5) and Astral Clairvoyance (p. 106) that allow the caster to grant a subject the ability to see or assense through mana barriers (which normally stop Clairvoyance and are opaque on the astral). If the barrier does not resist the spell with its Force, the subject can see/assense distant scenes through the barrier as if physically or astrally present within the sensory range of the spell. Magicians cannot cast spells at targets they see using these spells. Casting these spells does not alert the creator of the mana barrier.

Mana Window bypasses mana barriers on the physical plane with its clairvoyant physical sight. Astral Window bypasses astral mana barriers with its clairvoyant assensing. The caster must touch the subject of the spell, and for Astral Window the subject must be astrally active.

## Mindnet, Mindnet Extended

| MINDNET                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC, AREA) |
| **Type:** M             | **Range:** T (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S         | **Drain:** F     | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| MINDNET EXTENDED                 |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC, EXTENDED AREA) |
| **Type:** M                      | **Range:** T (A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S                  | **Drain:** F + 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Mindnet is a variation of the Mindlink spell (p. 287, SR5) designed to allow telepathic communication between a group of voluntary people. Everyone in the group can freely talk, exchange images, and emote as long as they remain within range of the target of the spell (the person touched when the spell is cast). The number of people participating in the group (excluding the target) serves as the threshold for the Spellcasting Test. Once any participants have left the range of the spell, it must be recast for them to once again to gain the benefits of Mindnet, though the other participants may continue to participate in the link as long as they remain in range and the spell is sustained.

Mindnet is an area spell, while Mindlink Extended is an extended area spell.

## Night Vision

| NIGHT VISION           |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** P            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Night Vision grants a voluntary subject low-light vision like that provided by the low-light vision cybernetic eyeware enhancement (p. 444, SR5).

## Sense Cryptesthesia

| [SENSE] CRYPTESTHESIA  |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M            | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S        | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Sense Cryptesthesia (“paranormal perception”) is an advanced form of Clairvoyance (p. 286, SR5) and Clairaudience (p. 286, SR5). Each Cryptesthesia spell allows the subject to utilize a different augmented sense such as low-light vision, thermographic vision, enhanced smell, or ultrasound at a chosen point within the spell’s range. These senses mimic the effects of headware cybernetic enhancements (p.451, SR5). The subject need not possess the sense to utilize it while the spell is powered. However, each sense requires a different spell (for example, Sonar Cryptesthesia or Enhanced Vision Cryptesthesia).

Magicians cannot use senses granted by Cryptesthesia to target others with spells. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.

## Spatial Sense, Spatial Sense Extended

| SPATIAL SENSE   |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, AREA) |
| **Type:** P     | **Range:** T(A)  | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S | **Drain:** F – 3 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| SPATIAL SENSE, EXTENDED  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (PASSIVE, EXTENDED AREA) |
| **Type:** P              | **Range:** T(A)  | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S          | **Drain:** F – 1 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Spatial Sense grants the subject an innate awareness and knowledge of his physical surroundings within range of the spell in terms of landscape, geography, and architecture. The layout knowledge lasts as only long as the spell is sustained and is not retained when the spell ends (though the subject can make a map or recite directions before ending the spell). The net hits scored on the Detection Spell Results table (p. 286, SR5) determine how much detail the spell provides, progressing from a general idea of what’s where, to a rough map of the area, to knowing each exit and how secure they are. The spell works in all directions (three-dimensional) and may uncover hidden layout features such as ventilation shafts, secret rooms, and sewer tunnels. It will not detect security features or living things. Areas that are protected by a mana barrier are experienced as “blank spots.”

## Thought Recognition, Area Thought Recognition

| THOUGHT RECOGNITION            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC, DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M                    | **Range:** T | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S                | **Drain:** F | **Source:** SR5:SG |

| AREA THOUGHT RECOGNITION |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC, AREA)  |
| **Type:** M              | **Range:** LOS(A) | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S          | **Drain:** F + 2  | **Source:** SR5:SG |

This set of spells is a less intrusive form of Mind Probe (p. 287, SR5). The caster grants the subject the ability to scan the target’s surface thoughts for a particular word, phrase, sound, or image chosen when the spell is cast. This spell does not dig through the target’s brain for information; it merely verifies if a target is actively thinking about a particular person, place, event, or thing. Investigators use this spell to determine if a target has knowledge of something (such as a murder weapon) that they otherwise wouldn’t to determine if they are involved with a crime. Spies use this spell to determine if someone is tailing or looking for them.

Thought Recognition is used on one particular target, while Area Thought Recognition scans the minds of everyone within the area.

## Translate

| TRANSLATE                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| (ACTIVE, PSYCHIC/DIRECTIONAL) |
| **Type:** M                   | **Range:** T     | **Damage:**        |
| **Duration:** S               | **Drain:** F – 4 | **Source:** SR5:SG |

Translate creates a low-level telepathic connection between the subject and a specific target within range of the sense (chosen when the spell is cast). This allows the subject and target to understand each other’s speech as if the subject spoke the target’s native language. The spell translates general intent rather than exact phrasing. This is useful for simple conversations, but not delicate diplomacy where the tact of a skilled translator is needed. This spell is often used for international corporate and government conversations. Translate may be used to communicate with any sapient species that uses language (such as sasquatch or merrow), but may not be used to communicate with non-sapient animals. The hits from the Spellcasting Test determine the quality of the translation. The caster must touch the subject to trigger the spell.
