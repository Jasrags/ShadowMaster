ImpZetaChem initially intended to develop an innovative industrial-grade degreaser. On paper and in computer modeling, that’s exactly what they did. But when they tested their creation, they discovered the viscous liquid not only didn’t remove grease, it was itself almost impossible to remove without specialized solvents. More importantly, any surface coated with their experimental cleaner became for all practical intents and purposes friction-free. ImpZetaChem wasted no time in rebranding their failed cleaner as an industrial lubricant. Though chemically improbable, Ultra-Glide works—the coating produces a zero-friction surface that all but eliminates wear and heat in machinery. Sold to consumers in jugs and spray cans, Ultra-Glide is popular with security providers who use it to coat approaches to potential breach points. It can also be used in squirt weapons or in standard paint grenades (applicable skill tests apply). To move across a surface (per meter) coated with Ultra-Glide requires an Gymnastics + Agility (3) [Physical] Test, or an Agility (4) Test to hold on to an Ultra-Glide coated item.

Hold-Fast was developed at MIT&T as an effort to meet—and cash in on—Dunkelzhan’s call for a non-lethal alternative to conventional firearms. Its intended purpose is to quickly immobilize subjects without harming them. Though initially rejected by the Draco Foundation for “not meeting the necessary criteria,” Hold-Fast was adopted by Lone Star after their own independent trials, conducted on the streets of several CAS cities, proved it to be effective in apprehension and crowd control. Hold-Fast is a liquid that is delivered through a sprayer not unlike a fire extinguisher. Once exposed to oxygen, the liquid hardens to form a clear plastic-like shell in about thirty seconds. Standard Hold-Fast become brittle after two hours, while the long-lasting formula is stable until removed with a solvent. Use Taser ranges for Hold-Fast sprayer. Breaking free of Hold-Fast requires a Strength (4) Test.
