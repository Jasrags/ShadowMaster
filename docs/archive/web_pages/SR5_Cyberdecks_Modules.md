A cyberdeck module is a prefabricated component that extends the capabilities of your deck. Each cyberdeck has one module slot inside its case. Inserting, removing, or swapping modules requires a Hardware + Logic [Mental] (1) Test and about half a minute of time (10 Combat Turns).

Modules aren’t as robust as your average deck and are vulnerable to Matrix damage. If your deck is ever bricked, any module in it becomes a useless hunk of slag, even if you repair the deck.

## Hardening

| AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 3R    | 1,500¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| The hardening module acts as a shield between your deck and incoming damage. It has a Matrix Condition Monitor with five boxes, and it takes damage before your deck does. These boxes cannot be repaired. |

## Induction Receiver

| AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 10R   | 1,200¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| When you have this module installed, your deck can tap into data cables and hardlines on contact. By placing your cyberdeck directly onto the cable, it becomes directly connected to the devices on either side of the cable. |

## Multidimensional Coprocessor

| AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 7R    | 1,400¥ | SR5:DT |

| Matrix Initiative +1D6 | |
| This tongue-twister of a module speeds up Matrix signals and commands, granting the deck’s operator an additional +1D6 to Matrix Initiative (remember that you can never roll more than 5D6 worth of initiative dice). |

## Overwatch Mask

| AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 9F    | 4,200¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| This handy module confuses GOD’s watchful eye by pretending it’s part of the Matrix enforcement system. The Matrix doesn’t converge on a deck with this mod until its Overwatch Score reaches 4 more than normal (making it 44 in normal conditions). |

## Program Carrier

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 2     | 900¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| This module holds a program that your deck can run permanently. You pick the program and we lock it in at manufacture, which means you can’t change it, but hey, it’s an extra program. Price includes the program cost. |

## Self-Destruct

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 12F   | 200¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| This module is 98 percent explosive material by weight. When your deck detects a specific pre-determined condition (chosen by you), the module explodes, turning your cyberdeck into a fragmentation grenade—see p. 435, SR5 for all the mayhem that causes. The deck, of course, is completely unrecoverable, meaning maybe don’t put one of these into a Fairlight Paladin. |

## Vectored Signal Filter

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| ----- | ---- | ------ |
| 3     | 800¥ | SR5:DT |

| | |
| By adding a dedicated signal filter to your deck, this module gives you Noise Reduction 2. |
