Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing grenade and missile launchers. All suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil (p. 175). Launchers can take top and underbarrel accessories. Naturally, grenade launchers fire minigrenades, and missile launchers launch missiles or rockets.

This bullpup-configuration grenade launcher is popular, since it can fire in semi-auto mode and carries substantially more minigrenades than its competitors.

| Missile | Missile | Missile | SA/BF | – | 4 \* 2(m) | 20F | 14,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

Missile Ammo
: The Yakosoku can load up to 4 different types of missiles, 2 in each tube.

Wireless
: The missile(s) to be launched can be chosen via the integrated wireless smartgun connection as a Free Action.

Fire both
: Firing both tubes at once requires the attacker to split their dice pool or use a self-guided system in one of the tubes.

A direct competitor of the Ballista, the Yakusoku trades the security features and bells and whistles for the versatility of being able to fire both missiles and rockets. Its dual-tube design also allows for faster firing.

- Faster firing is a bending of the truth. The Yak can fire both tubes at once but trying to aim both at once is tough. Smart users load a self-guided missile in one and a rocket in the other. They aim the rocket but launch the missile at the same time.

## Onotari Arms Ballista MML

| Missile | Missile | Missile | SS | – | 4(m) | 19F | 7,500¥ | SR5:R&G |

Area Targetting
: The Ballista can attack with both direct and indirect missile fire. A handheld laser target designator is linked to the backpack unit with a fiber-optic cable securing the system from hacking.

Wireless
: The Ballista can also accept orders wirelessly from other target designators linked to the user’s PAN (see PANs and WANs, p. 233, SR5).

Reload
: The magazine is hard to replace and requires 3 Complex Actions if done by a second person. The wearer would need to remove the backpack (Complex Action), replace the magazine (3 Complex Actions), and then put the backpack back on (2 Complex Actions) in order to change it themselves.

Leave it to Saeder-Krupp to design a system great for taking dragons out of the sky. The Ballista saw a lot of action recently during the Dragon Wars, and mercenary units have picked up quite a bit of the overstock that was produced in expectation of a longer conflict. The system is a backpack and launcher set up that holds four extra missiles that will automatically reload after each shot. The setup comes with a handheld laser designator for independent targeting but the missiles can respond to other designators and their own internal systems.

- Don’t fool yourself into thinking this will take any serious dragon out of the sky by itself. It can be part of a larger strategy, but that strategy had better be pretty damn big.

Modifiers
: SmartGun

Wireless
: You can use the wireless link trigger for your missiles, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface sidebar, p. 222).

This Saeder-Krupp-developed military missile launcher is designed to fire rockets or guided missiles, of any type. It has two separate barrels and firing chambers, and can load up to two missiles at once, which need not be of the same type. Due to backblast issues, it is not capable of “giving ‘em both barrels.” It features an internal smartgun system.
