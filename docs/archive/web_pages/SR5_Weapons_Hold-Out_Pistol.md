Hold-out pistols are very concealable and are perfect for sneaking into a meet or wearing as a back-up piece. They don’t have much else going for them, being both weak and inaccurate. Use the Pistols skill when firing a hold-out pistol. Hold-outs can’t take accessories.

The New Model Revolver is Colt’s return to the small-revolver market, launched with a marketing campaign aimed at young homeowners and small security firms. The New Model is manufactured in a variety of small caliber and is largely of conventional design. The cylinder uses a simple left-side drop to allow rapid reloading with the appropriate manufacturer-approved speed loader. This model is only produced at Colt’s Connecticut facility and has largely remained rare outside of northeastern UCAS. Inside the UCAS, citizens can be proud to purchase from one of their homegrown success stories. Trust the quality of a proven manufacturer. Trust the Legend™.

- A number of these were dropped into Baltimore’s shadow market a few months ago. Lone Star removed their official endorsement of the pistol two weeks later.
  - Sunshine

- It’s another small-caliber, no-frills pistol put on the market for civilian consumption. It poses little real threat to government or corporate security teams.
  - Hard Exit

- For a cheap piece of crap, it’s surprisingly accurate. I managed to shoot a 2cm group at nearly 30 meters with one.

- Did that group happen to land on the nose of a smuggler who owed you money?

This is a classic double-barreled derringer in an over-under barrel combination. It packs a punch for its size, but on the downside it has one of the most diminutive “magazine” capacities on the marketjust one bullet per barrel. Both barrels can be fired at once as a short burst (see Not Enough Bullets, p. 180).
