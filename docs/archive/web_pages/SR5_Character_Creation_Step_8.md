FINAL CALCULATIONS

At this point, characters are basically done, though there are several derived mechanics that must be calculated before they are ready to be played. Since many of these are adjusted by augmentations, it is best to wait until all decisions have been made on skills and attributes before making these calculations.

As explained previously, Initiative determines the order that characters act in combat situations. Initiative is also rolled to determine whether a character is surprised in a combat situation. This pool is determined by adding Intuition + Reaction. Both non-augmented and augmented attributes should be added together and listed the same as attributes, with the non-augmented number first followed by the augmented number in parentheses. Also be sure to note the number of Initiative Dice the character gets; all characters start with 1 (noted as 1D6) and can receive additional dice from augmentations. These should be listed after the Initiative Rating so the listing looks like this: 9 (11) + 2D6. There is also Matrix Initiative for those that are in the Matrix, and Astral Initiative for magic users and spirits in astral space. Matrix Initiative is determined by whether a character is in cold-sim or hot-sim. For details see Astral Initiative (p. 229) or Matrix Initiative (p. 313).

Inherent limits are limits imposed on a character by their physiological or psychological makeup; all characters have them. See Tests and Limits (p. 46) for more information. The formulas for these inherent limits are given in the Final Calculations table. When calculating all Inherent limits, round the result up to the nearest whole number. For Social limits, round up Essence to the nearest whole number prior to calculating the cost. Every character has a Condition Monitor that tells the player how much Physical and Stun damage they can take before falling unconscious. The formulae for these are found in the Final Calculations table. For more information on using the Condition Monitor, see Damage, p. 169.

Technomancers possess what is called a Living Persona in the Matrix. This Living Persona has specific attributes that are used instead of their normal physical or mental attributes. Information on the Living Persona can be found on p. 250.

To make sure your character is ready to rock with a minimum of complication and hassle, here’s a checklist of things to remember when designing a shadowrunner.

- Make sure you choose each row of the Priority Table once.

- Remember to make note of any applicable racial advantages or disadvantages (thermal vision, lowlight vision) on your character sheet for game play.

- Check to make sure you have raised your Edge and/or Magic or Resonance with your special attribute points that your character received when you selected your metatype.

- Make sure you have spent all your attribute points.
  - Your character may only have one Physical or Mental Attribute at the natural attribute maximum limit (or 1 higher with the Exceptional Attribute quality) at character creation. This rule does not apply to Edge, Magic, or Resonance. These can be at their maximum if the player has the points to raise them that far.

- In the Magic or Resonance column, doublecheck to make sure you have recorded all the benefits from that priority level on your character sheet (if applicable). Aspected magicians only receive skills from the one category they select (Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting) they select. Mystic adepts do not get their Power Points for free like other adepts, but must spend 2 Karma per Power Point.

- Review the qualities that you have purchased and make all requisite changes to your stats. Make certain to note the bonuses or negative modifiers on your character sheet.

- Check to make sure you have spent all your skill and skill group points on Active, Knowledge, and Language skills. Make sure you have all the specializations that you desire from spending priority points. Review skill groups and the individual skills you have bought to verify there are no duplications.

- Review the gear that you have purchased with your resources. Make sure you have acquired everything you want, and double-check for things you may have forgotten (commlinks, cyberdecks, ammo, vehicles, Lifestyles, fake SINs and licenses, etc.). If you are playing a dwarf or a troll, make certain you have taken their gear cost modifiers into consideration. You may convert up to 10 Karma into nuyen (20,000 nuyen). You may carry over 5,000 nuyen from your resources and add them to your starting nuyen.

- Make sure you have calculated your Essence, Initiative, and Inherent Limits, and acquired contacts.

- Review your Karma expenditures, and spend any remaining that you wish. Remember, you can carry up to 7 Karma from character creation into the game.
