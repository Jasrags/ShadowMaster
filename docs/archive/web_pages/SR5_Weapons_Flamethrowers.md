**All about Flamethrowers**

| Flamethrowers require a small flame to ignite the fuel mixture. Igniting the flame require a Complex Action to ready it. If the flamethrower is connected via wireless to the users PAN, it’s only a Simple Action. A wireless DNI connection makes it a Free Action. Flamethrowers can be used to blast a single target or they can be used to spread flame over a wider area in an attempt to strike multiple targets. The area attack takes a Complex Action and allows the user to attack up to two additional targets within two meters of another target. A single Attack Test is made against all targets, and they make their Defense Tests separately. The DV is reduced by 2 for each additional target the flame is engulfing. Flamethrowers can also be used for laying down Suppressive Fire (p. 179, SR5), consuming four shots, and they can take advantage of the same rules as Flechette Suppressive Fire (p. 120). Flamethrowers deal fire damage (p. 171, SR5) and will set fire to almost every item caught in the attack’s area of effect for at least a short period of time (gamemaster’s discretion). Flamethrowers use Taser ranges but suffer only a –1 penalty at Extreme range and no penalty at Long range or closer. Flamethrowers use the Exotic Ranged Weapon (Flamethrowers) skill. Flamethrowers cannot mount any accessories except biometric safety systems (Advanced Safety, p. 50). |

Flamethrowers are terrifying weapons that ignite a stream of gasoline and oil or napalm so they can spew flaming death. Older model flamethrowers store their fuel in a backpack-like tank, while the user holds a pistol-grip nozzle with a hose attached to supply the fuel. Modern handheld flamethrowers merge everything into a portable package about the size of a submachine gun or assault rifle. This means less fuel but a lot less shoot-the-fuel-tank-type situations.

Flamethrowers are fired with the Exotic Ranged Weapons: Flamethrowers skill. They require a Complex Action to be made ready to fire. They can be used for Suppressive Fire (p. 179, SR5). They also can be used to attack multiple targets; using a Complex Action means the shooter can attack with a fanning motion, striking up to three targets (as long as they are all within the weapon’s range and each target is within four meters of the others). This uses two units of the flamethrower’s ammo capacity.

Flamethrowers deal **[Fire damage](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Combat_Rules:Elemental_Damage#Fire_Damage "SR5:Combat Rules:Elemental Damage")**. Their range is listed with each individual flamethrower.

A recent release from Shiawase, the Incinerator is the first personal incendiary device to utilize advanced polymers in nearly every aspect of its construction. The advanced materials limited the thermal stress placed on the ignition chamber as well as ensuring the operator suffers limited discomfort from the intense heat. The recommended fuel mixture ensures complete combustion; field-expedience mixtures are still possible, but less efficient.

- I saw a few burn teams with these outside of Bogotá. They weren’t having much of a permanent effect against the trees.
  - Hard Exit

- What would you put on the powered slide mount? A tactical flashlight is a little redundant.
  - Slamm-0!

- If you mount a sensor of nearly any kind on it, you can perform as a sensor of a tactical net, the edge a good network gives you is impressive.
