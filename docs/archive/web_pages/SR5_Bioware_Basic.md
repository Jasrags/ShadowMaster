Bioware is subtler, more holistic, and less invasive than cyberware, at the cost of being substantially pricier. Instead of replacing body parts with machines, bioware augments the body’s own functions and integrates transplanted organs that function as natural features. The application of biotechnology is a tricky business, as the fine balance of homeostasis between the body’s organic systems must be maintained. In the last decade, bionics and bio-engineering techniques have taken bioware from cutting edge to commonplace. Bioware is more expensive monetarily, costs less Essence, and is much harder to spot. Also—and we’d like to think this goes without saying—bioware has no wireless capability at all.

## Adrenaline Pump (R 1–3)

| Trigger Pump Free Action Active Benefits Ignore Injury Modifiers Can't Fall Unconscious +Rating to STR, AGI, REA, WIL Active Duration Rating x 1D6 Combat Turns After Duration Duration amount of Stun Damage (Resist with Body + Willpower) Recharge Rate 1 Hour |  |
| This enhanced gland is implanted in the lower abdomen, connected to both supradrenal glands. When dormant, the pump is merely a reservoir for adrenaline. When activated, a small muscular sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrated adrenaline into the blood stream. Physical and emotional stress can force your pump to activate if you fail a Composure Test (p. 152); otherwise you can trigger it as a Free Action. While the pump is active, you ignore injury modifiers and don’t fall unconscious, even if your Stun Condition Monitor is filled. You can’t rest, but the adrenaline pump’s Rating is added to your Strength, Agility, Reaction, and Willpower attributes. The pump works for Rating x 1D6 Combat Turns (the pump can’t be switched off early). When time’s up, you crash and take Stun damage equal to the number of Combat Turns the pump was active (use your natural Body + Willpower to resist the damage).After the effects end, your attribute values return to normal and you stop ignoring injury modifiers or unconsciousness from Stun damage. After use, the pump requires 1 hour to regenerate its supply. During that time, it cannot be activated. |

| The molecular structure of your bones is altered to increase density and tensile strength. Ligaments are strengthened, and the increased bone density increases your weight a bit. Your Body attribute is increased by the bone density Rating for the purpose of damage resistance tests. You also deal Physical damage in unarmed combat, based on the Rating of the augmentation (see the Bone Density Augmentation table). Bone density augmentation is incompatible with other augmentations to the bones, including bone lacing cyberware. |

| Vision LowLight |  |
| These transgenic vat-grown implants are very literally cats’ eyes with a modified DNA profile and occipital connecting structures. The structure of cat’s eyes amplifies light and enhances night vision, providing lowlight vision. Cat’s eyes are slit and reflective, just like, well, a cat’s. This bioware is obviously not compatible with cyberware eye enhancements or replacements. |

| Escape Artist +1 DP Physical Limit +1 |  |
| A number of procedures like joint-surface coating, re-lubrication, and tendon and ligament augmentation lead to more fluid muscle and joint action. Enhanced articulation provides you with a +1 dice pool modifier to your Escape Artist skill and a +1 increase to your Physical limit (cumulative with other limit modifiers). |

| Add Rating to Strength |  |
| This biological weaving treatment enhances existing muscle tissue, rather than replacing it with vat-grown muscles. Specially grown muscle cables are woven into existing muscle fibers, enhancing muscle mass and brute strength while providing a bulkier look. Muscle augmentation adds its rating to your Strength. This bioware is incompatible with augmentations that increase Strength, including the muscle replacements cyberware. |

## Muscle Toner (R 1–4)

| A web of biofibers in the skin provides the equivalent of personal armor while being virtually indistinguishable from natural skin. Orthoskin adds its Rating to your Armor Rating, and is cumulative with other Armor. Orthoskin cannot be combined with skin augmentations that give you Armor, including dermal plating. |

## Pathogenic Defense (R 1–6)

| Reduce 2 or more Physical Damage by 1 |  |
| Platelet factories increase your body’s ability to handle Physical damage by accelerating the production of platelets within bone marrow and their concentration in the blood, which helps stop bleeding faster. Any time you would take 2 or more boxes of damage to your Physical Condition Monitor, reduce the damage by one box. |

| This skin flap can be located anywhere on your body. A nerveless “sheath” of flesh concealed by the flap is perfect for hiding a small object—it’s the bioware version of a **smuggling compartment** . The skin pocket has a Concealability of –10. It takes a Complex Action to add or remove an item from a skin pocket. |

## Suprathyroid Gland

| Pros +1 to AGI, BOD, REA, STR Cons LifeStyle Cost + 25% |  |
| Placed on top of your existing thyroid gland, the suprathyroid gland supersedes the metabolic functions of your thyroid. The enhanced metabolism produces more energy, supercharging you. While you’re supercharged, you might want to supersize—to fuel your optimized metabolism, you’ll need to eat twice as much as normal. You get a +1 to your Agility, Body, Reaction, and Strength, along with a 25 percent boost in lifestyle costs. And you might get a bit hyperactive. |

## Symbiotes (R 1–4)

| Tailored micro-organisms in your bloodstream greatly enhance your healing. Add the Rating of the symbiotes as a dice pool modifier on healing tests (Physical and Stun). However, the symbiotes have unusual dietary requirements that must be met to keep them alive. You need to pay (Rating x 200) nuyen per month for special symbiote food, although if you have a High Lifestyle or better it’s covered. |

| These pheromones are specially tailored to subtly influence others and can be released at will. Tailored pheromones add their Rating as a dice pool modifier to your skill tests for skills in the Acting and Influence skill groups, but only when the person you’re using them on is within a comfortable conversation range—if they can’t smell you, the pheromones don’t work. Tailored pheromones also work on you to make you feel better about yourself; increase your Social limit by the Rating. Tailored pheromones have no effect on magical abilities and tests. |

|  |  |
| While chemical glands were originally intended to produce insulin for diabetics, megacorporations soon learned that there was a market for any number of unusual natural pharmaceuticals and organs that could produce them, and the streets quickly followed suit. The chemical gland is a small organic sac that produces a single substance. Often implanted in place of the appendix, the chemical gland can also be located in many other spots inside the body, such as the roof of the mouth so it can be used with fangs, or perhaps near an internal weapon system to provide a coating of venom. Even more unusual placements have been dreamed up. Each gland can only produce a single compound, chosen when purchased, and the selection cannot be changed. These compounds must be naturally occurring and not synthetic. The gland produces a single dose every twenty-four hours and can hold as many as four doses at once. An expanded reservoir is, of course, available. Note that the implantation of a chemical gland in no way provides immunity, or even improved resistance, from the substance for the user. The gland’s protective sac keeps the compound from leaking into the body naturally, but if introduced in another way (such as biting one’s self with fangs), the user can be exposed to it. In addition to the base price, the chemical gland’s cost is further increased by an amount equal to the cost of one hundred doses of the chemical compound it produces. The Availability of the chemical gland is 12, or equal to the compound created, whichever is higher, and is Restricted or Forbidden if the chemical carries such a flag. A user may have several chemical glands. The chemical gland may be connected to a cybernetic reservoir, or have a release methodology chosen from below. |

### Gradual Release

| - | - | - | -¥ | SR5:CF |

| Benefits User under the effect of the chemical at all times |  |
| A chemical gland can be used to leak its substance continuously into the body, ensuring that a dose is present at all times. This leaves the user under the effect of the chemical at all times and eliminates any reserve. This can easily lead to terminal addiction for certain chemicals. |

### Exhalation Spray

| Benefits:Gain an Exotic Ranged Weapon (Sprayer) attack OR inhale a dose of inhalation vector drug or poison |  |
| Implanted in the neck and sealed off via a sphincter, the exhalation spray is triggered by an active learned reflex, where the user first takes a deep breath, then hand pressure against the throat opens the inner sphincter, which disperses into a strong exhalation, expelling the chemical in an aerosol spray. Only contactor inhalation-vectored chemicals are of much use in this method, and the user must be careful not to inhale until the dose is fully discharged. Alternately, the user can manually activate the sphincter and inhale a dose themselves, a popular approach for many asthmatics. When exhaled, the dose expands in a cone two meters long and two meters wide at its widest point, which may catch multiple targets if they’re placed closely enough. The Exotic Ranged Weapon (Sprayer) skill is used for any attacks with this augmentation. A user may only have one exhalation sprayer. |

| Benefits Inject chemical with an action |  |
| The most common method is a simple internal release, triggered by mental command not terribly different from flexing a muscle. In this way, it serves as a sort of biological auto-injector. This is the default method of release and is included in the cost of the gland. |

### Spit

| Benefit Gain access to a Exotic Ranged Weapon (Spitter) attack |  |
| An unusual choice as it always exposes the user to the chemical, spitting involves a sphincter added to the mouth that can be opened by contraction of facial muscles or continuous tongue placement, unlocking a single dose of the substance for use. Metahuman spit with a concentrated chemical core can be launched up to 5 meters. A user may only have one implant, and they use the Exotic Ranged Weapon (Spitter) skill to employ it. |

| Benefit Coat bioware/cyberware weapon in a chemical |  |
| By connecting the chemical gland directly to the root system of a weapon augmentation, the weapon can be coated with a single dose each time it’s extended. Alternately, it can be connected to fangs or a stinger, allowing for injection only upon penetration. If used as an injector, a natural weapon attack must score two additional hits, which must be used for an injection rather than used to increase damage. |

| Benefits Immunity to substances +2 against Contact Penalties -2 Body on Fatigue tests Hot environments increase in everity by one step |  |
| By sealing the skin tightly, the user trades natural cooling via sweating for a sealed system, allowing them to resist chemical attacks more easily, including complete immunity to . Not recommended for athletes or others who regularly indulge in endurance-based activities, as the lack of a cooling system other than panting is quite dangerous for metahumans! Drink fluid often. In addition to immunity to any DMSO-carried substance, the user gains +2 Body to resist any contact-vector toxin. The user also suffers a penalty of –2 Body for any Fatigue test and suffers an increase in severity by one step from any hot environment. (p. 172, SR5); for example, a Moderate situation for others is Harsh for the user. |

| While many expect this mod to involve scales, that would be a simple cosmetic modification unconnected to the actual upgrade. Dragon Hide weaves flame-retardant materials into the orthoskin, which distributes thermal impact, prevents blistering, and reduces overall burning as energy dissipates across the larger surface. The user gains +2 Body for resisting Fire damage, but also has a –2 penalty on Perception Tests involving heat detection. |

| Use of conductive materials allows the user to channel any internal electrical weapon throughout their entire body—quite a surprise for someone who thought they were safe while grappling a target! Note that electrical weaponry is sold separately. The user gains +4 Body to resist their own electrical discharge, due to passing the shock outwards, but suffers a –2 Body penalty to resist other electrical attacks as their skin transmits the shock into their organs more efficiently. This augmentation is not compatible with the insulation augmentation. |

| Benefits +2 Body for resisting Damage x5 time interval for harsh cold for Fatigue damage |  |
| Thicker than normal orthoskin, penguin blubber produces a protective oil that prevents skin from drying and cracking in sub-freezing temperatures while protecting internal organs against the cold. It also gives the user a somewhat tubby look. Users with penguin blubber can happily frolic barefoot on snow or take a dip in freezing water, enjoying temperatures as low as –10 degrees Celsius without long-term effect. Adding insulating material over this can result in a toasty-warm explorer in even the harshest Antarctic temperatures. The user gains +2 Body for resisting cold damage and can quintuple the time exposed to harsh cold environs for purposes of Fatigue damage. |

| This simple skin is coated with naturally refreshing water-repelling oils that allow the user to cut through the waves with ease. The user’s skin retains a somewhat moist appearance at all times. Sealskin removes all penalties associated with moving through water, allowing the user to operate underwater as easily as in air. Note that this does not include either water breathing functionality or swimming ability (those are sold separately). |

### Sharkskin

{{SR5:Cyberware Template|Type=Basic|Device=Sharkskin

|Essence=0.25|Availability=8|Cost=8,000

|Special=;Benefit:+1 [[Reach}} in unarmed combat
|Description=The user’s skin is coated with denticles, small abrasive lumps comparable to sandpaper. While quite difficult to cause true damage to a target with rubbing, the slow abrasion can lead to skin loss and bleeding, if not mortal wounds. This makes it quite difficult to strike or grapple the user in unarmed combat situations. The user can also scuff objects or pop balloons by simply brushing up against them.

A user with sharkskin gains an effective Reach of +1 for unarmed combat, reflecting these assorted advantages.
