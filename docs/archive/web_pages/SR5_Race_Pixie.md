| They don’t just live in treehouses. Those little houses usually have a secret door that leads to a tunnel down through the tree trunk and into the ground, where they have built entire underground cities. Plan 9 Speaking of criminal SINs and trying to fit in, Ashindar, a black-feathered pixie, was caught by the government of Tír Tairngire and convicted of murder after his assassination of a Telestrian exec. He killed the exec using an assault cannon, or so the media depictions seemed to show. The weapon was actually a small-caliber rifle, custom modified to fit his diminutive stature. He escaped custody shortly after the trial. Chainbreaker He let himself get caught. It was a message: Stay out of Brocéliande Forest. Thorn |

These small humanoids resemble miniature elves with wings. They bear ethnic traits from around the world, usually similar to the local metahuman population. Pixies stand under a half-meter tall, though their feet are rarely on the ground to measure them. Their wingspan measures approximately one meter across. The average pixie’s wings resemble iridescent dragonfly wings, but other variations have been noted, including those mimicking the wing profiles of bats, birds of prey, butterflies, and grasshoppers, and pixies claim an even wider spectrum of wings is possible. Regardless of their wings’ appearance, pixies use an innate manipulation of mana for flight instead of actual aerodynamics. They also possess the innate magical ability to conceal themselves; this seems to be their natural state, as they immediately disappear at the moment of death, which makes postmortem study and taxonomical classification of the species a challenge. Unsavory elements have attempted living autopsies, but pixies are tricky and tough catch, and those who claim to have information from such procedures are not necessarily to be trusted.

Pixies tend to live in forested areas away from cities. They group themselves by family and develop treehouse villages. On rare occasions, pixies have been known to try out life in urban sprawls. Their size is usually the most limiting factor, though variations in mana levels also affect their ability to fly and magically conceal themselves.

The Korrigan, a coalition of paranormal entities, spirits, and fey entities, are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the creation of the independent nation of Brocéliande Forest within France. Pixies are a major force in this group, providing leadership and direction (insofar as this loose gathering allows itself to be led).

**Estimated Worldwide Population:** Unknown

**Population Centers:** Brocéliande Forest (Brittany region of France), United Kingdom, Tír na nÓg, Tír Tairngire, Ukraine, Duchy of Pomoyra, and the Black Forest Troll Republic

**International Status:** France is the only nation that issues permanent SINs to pixies; the governments of Tír Tairngire, the United Kingdom, Tír na nÓg, and the UCAS issue criminal SINs to pixies convicted of a crime. NeoNET and Evo are the only megacorporations with pixie corporate citizens.
