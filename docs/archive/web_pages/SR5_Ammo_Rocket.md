Rockets are projectiles consisting of a light metal or plastic body with stabilizing fins, a propulsion system (usually solid-chemical) and a warhead. Missiles are rockets that carry internal guidance systems, making them more expensive than standard “dumb” rockets.
Rules for firing rockets and missiles are on p. 181. Rockets and missiles are set to arm when they have traveled 10 meters from their point of origin and explode on impact. This safety feature can be disabled with an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test.
In addition to any other wireless bonus, all rockets and missiles have the following wireless feature

Disable Safety
: Armorer + Logic [Mental] (4, 5 Minutes)

Wireless
: You can use the wireless link trigger for your rocket or missile, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface sidebar, p. 222).

| DV  | AP     | BLAST | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |

| AV rockets/missiles contain a shapedcharge warhead designed to burn or punch its way through a vehicle or barrier. Though the impact causes a blast, it is limited compared to that of a High-Explosive projectile. AV attacks have an AP of –10 against vehicles and barriers, –4 against other targets. |

## Fragmentation

| DV     | AP  | BLAST | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |
| ------ | --- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| 23P(f) | +5  | –1/m  | 12F   | 2,000¥ | Core   |

| Used principally against people, the warhead discharges high-speed metal or plastic-metal fragments designed to tear into unprotected flesh. These rockets/missiles are very effective against unprotected individuals, but fairly ineffective against barriers, structures, and vehicles. |

## High-explosive

| DV  | AP  | BLAST | AVAIL | COST   | SOURCE |

| HE rockets/missiles are designed to do heavy damage to a large area. Their blast pattern is similar to that of a grenade, but much larger. They are not particularly effective against hardened targets, such as vehicles or protected military structures. HE weapons use the standard grenade rules for determining the blast and its effects. |
