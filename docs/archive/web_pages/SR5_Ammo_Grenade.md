Grenades are small, self-contained explosive packages. Minigrenades are grenades specifically designed for use with grenade launchers, set to arm when they have traveled 5 meters from their point of origin and explode on impact (unless using an airburst link, p. 431). This safety feature can be disabled with an Armorer + Logic [Mental] (4, 5 Minutes) Extended Test. Minigrenades have the same cost and effects as standard grenades.
Use the Throwing Weapons skill when throwing grenades, or Heavy Weapons when launching a grenade from a grenade launcher. Follow the rules for Grenades, p. 181. Grenades and similar explosives can also be rigged with a tripwire to set up as a basic booby-trap. This requires an Extended Demolitions + Logic [Mental] (8, 1 Complex Action) Test. In addition to any other wireless bonus, all grenades have the following wireless feature (use it with caution):

: You can use the wireless link trigger for your grenades, even if you don’t have DNI (Direct Neural Interface sidebar, p. 222).

## Flash-Bang

| Upon detonation, these “concussion” or “stun” grenades explode to create a bright, loud, shocking blast distributed equally over a radius of 10 meters. |

## Flash-Pak

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| DV      | AP  | BLAST   | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| Charges 10 Discharge Rate 1 Charge Per Combat Turn Recharge Rate 1 Charge Per 10 Seconds Wireless The strobe sequence can avoid directing strong flashes at the subscribed character; they suffer only half glare penalties from the flash-pak, rounded down. It can recharge by induction, regaining one charge per hour. | |
| Not a grenade per se, this is an electronic unit the size of a pack of cigarettes containing four quartz-halogen micro-flashes designed to fire in random strobing sequence to blind opponents. Anyone looking in the direction of a flash-pak receives a –4 dice pool penalty on attack tests due to the strobing (flare compensation goggles, glasses, etc. reduce this modifier to –2, while flare compensation in cybereyes or as a retinal modification reduces this modifier to –1). The flash-pak has 10 charges; when activated it uses one charge per Combat Turn. When plugged in, it recharges one charge every 10 seconds. |

## Fragmentation

| | |
| These classic killing devices are designed to spread a cloud of deadly shrapnel over a large area, seriously injuring soft targets. |

| These grenades are designed to deliver a large blast and concentrated hurt. |

## Gas

| Duration 4 Combat Turns | |
| Instead of exploding, the gas grenade releases a cloud of gas over an area with a radius of 10 meters. This is usually riot control/CS gas, but many other chemical or toxin payloads can be chosen (Toxins, Drugs, and BTLs, p. 408). The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion). |

## Smoke

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| DV  | AP  | BLAST      | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| -   | -   | 10m Radius | 4R    | 40¥  | Core   |

| Duration 4 Combat Turns | |
| Similar to the gas grenade, a smoke grenade releases a cloud of smoke over an area with a diameter of 10 meters. The cloud obscures vision, applying visibility modifiers for smoke to relevant tests (p. 174). The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the gamemaster’s discretion). |

## Thermal Smoke

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| DV  | AP  | BLAST      | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| -   | -   | 10m Radius | 6R    | 60¥  | Core   |

| Duration 4 Combat Turns | |
| Identical to a smoke grenade, except that the smoke contains hot particles designed to obscure thermographic vision. Apply the visibility modifiers for thermal smoke (p. 174). The cloud lasts for approximately 4 Combat Turns (less in windy areas, longer in confined areas with poor ventilation, at the GM’s discretion). |

## Paint Grenade

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| A low-tech way of defeating pesky invisibility spells, marking something in a hurry, or just slotting someone off. Available in a variety of colors, the paint grenade has the same blast radius as the standard high-explosive grenade but none of the nasty death-aftereffects. Subjects within the blast radius are covered with a splatter of paint. Radioactive tracking dye can also be added for an additional 50 nuyen. |
