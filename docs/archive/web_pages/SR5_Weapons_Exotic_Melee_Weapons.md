Leave it to Ares to make something deadly even deadlier. The Queen of Hearts is the nickname for Ares’ monofilament garrote that will often take a head right off well before the target suffocates, though I’m certain that was part of the intended design. Other megacorps have copied the design, but Ares is by far the biggest name out there.

- Beware mistakes. A misplaced pinky can be the difference between a clean kill and a place on the dishonored yakuza list. The Queen of Hearts and her sister models are unforgiving on untrained fools.

- This model is decent with its special features that remove some of the safety features located on most chainsaws, but cheap street rats will still try and use their local hardware store model in a fight. Most learn about their mistake the hard way.

Monofilament makes everything better or so Ash Arms would like us to believe. While the civilian model is actually used for cutting things like concrete and sculpting stone, that is just never enough. Ash has retooled the monofilament cousin of the standard chainsaw as well and made it into a unique weapon that has probably cut off more limbs from brain-dead wielders than their intended victims. But boy is a successful hit awesome.

- Same problems occur here when people try and use the tools as the weapons. Darwin would be proud.

Whether it’s redirecting bulls, snagging wrists, or lashing infidels, the whip has seen an interesting history as a tool, a showpiece, a torture device, and a weapon.This versatility is both its greatest asset and its biggest detriment. The training that is needed to use this weapon is very specific, but a truly skilled individual can perform feats with this item unmatched by any other
weapon.

Nothing brings the terror of your imminent demise to a peak quite the same way as a shadowy figure wielding a scythe closing in on you. The progenitor of this weapon was a female assassin who goes by the name Keres. There have been a few copycats since, but none as skilled or successful. This weapon is custom made and is essentially a telescoping staff with a Smartsteel blade fused to one end. When collapsed, the staff part compresses together with a telescopic design, and the blade coils inside the end of the shaft. Collapsing or extending the scythe is a Complex Action. When collapsed, the scythe is the same size as a club or baton (0 Concealability modifer) and if inspected noticing the coiled blade can be diffcult (-4 Concealability Modifer). Wireless bonus: Collapsing or extending the scythe is a Simple Action.

This can be as simple as a string attached to a pair of pencils but is usually a far more professional tool. The garrote is a handheld weapon designed to quietly kill via strangulation. The weapon consists of a central string, usually semiflexible wire of some sort, attached to a pair of handles used to pull the weapon tight once it is wrapped around a targets neck. Death is slow and unpleasant as the target usually struggles intensely, so a strong stomach and skill are both required.

The top of each chain segment on this portable motorized saw is covered with monofilament wire. Ideal for cutting through trees, doors, and other immovable objects. A monofilament chainsaw is too unwieldy to make a good melee weapon (use Exotic Melee Weapon skill). When used against barriers, double the monofilament chainsaw’s Damage Value of 8P.

Skill
: Exotic Melee Weapon (Monofilament Whip)

Glitch
: You catch the weighted tip on something nearby and need to disentangle it before you make another proper attack with it.

Critical Glitch
: You hit yourself with the whip and take its base damage (resisted normally)

Wireless
: The whip can be readied with a Free Action, rather than a Simple Action.
: The whip's built-in safety system retracts automatically instead of getting you entangled on a glitch.
: Accuracy increased by 2.

Iconic. Terrifying. Deadly. Few weapons on the street are more feared. This monofilament line can cut through bone and armor like hot butter. The line extends out to two meters, and retracts into the weapon's handle when not in use. The whip action, the weighted tip, and the deadly thread of monofilament line itself make this weapon a potential danger to it's wielder.
