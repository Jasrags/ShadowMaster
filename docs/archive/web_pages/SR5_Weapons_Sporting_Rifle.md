The Garand has been a hallmark of quality since its introduction over a century ago. Newly manufactured, the current rifle is a fine successor to the original, with the original manufacturing tools used whenever possible to ensure it is as accurate and dependable as the originals were when manufactured.

- Another Monobe rebranded item, this time without any updates. I guess I can’t blame them, though, for capitalizing on the market—a shooting original goes for nearly 9,000¥, and restored ones go for nearly ten times that.
  - Baka Dabora

- How much money can a company make with essentially knockoffs of ancient weapons? You have to figure making copies of current Ares products would be more profitable.
  - /dev/grrl

- They’ve made enough in the past year to pay off roughly half of their loans from Wuxing’s MIB. While not quite enough to ensure full independence, they’re well on the way, and Wuxing is happy to take the shipping profits off the exports.

The first rifle everyone should use to learn to shoot, the 79S is a plinker’s dream. The small-bore rifle is accurate, easy to maintain, and just plain fun to shoot. An additional benefit is that the ammunition is widely available and less expensive when you arrange a bulk purchase. The 79S has minimal recoil, and with its limited power cartridge, down-range incidents are less likely to happen. Marlin supports youth marksmanship programs by providing this rifle to qualified organizations, teaching the next generation how to defend themselves.

- Really Glitch? If I get shot by one of these I’m more likely to die of embarrassment than blood loss.
  - Kane

- You might find a plinking rifle less interesting than a machine pistol, but there are far more plinking rifles of this caliber in UCAS than automatic weapons. It might not be relevant to your particular pursuits, but those who perform home invasions might end up seeing the wrong end of one.
  - Fianchetto

- The UCAS maintains the Civilian Markmanship Program to identify potential military recruits before they finish primary education. They also subsidize the manufacture of this type of rifle for that reason. Nothing like militarizing the kids of today to be the fodder of tomorrow’s wars.

- K\*ay St. Irregular

- How do I get cheap ammunition and what’s the discount? Figure the markup to street value and I might be able to set up a revenue source.
  - /dev/grrl

- It’s not enough to retire on, and not enough to risk getting shot by your buyers. Research that once you decide to be a fixer—it’s part of the way they make a profit supporting us.

A classic rifle for traditional shooters, the 3041’s lever action has been extensively reengineered to meet the toughest reliability standards, as shown by its selection by Illinois’ Department of Revenue as its issue long arm. The rifle’s barrel and action have been protected by Marlin’s proprietary anti-corrosion treatment to create an heirloom sure to last through generations of use.

- Aside from the one government purchase, most of these are in the hands of civilians. Repeating rifles don’t compare well to assault rifles for most government requirements.
  - Glitch

- The Illinois Comptroller is under investigation for that purchase, among other things. Apparently she pushed more than a couple of agencies into purchases of equipment they didn’t need. The last time the state’s Department of Revenue issued long arms was during the VITAS outbreak.
  - Kay St. Irregular

- So they actually give a bunch of clerks and bottom-dwelling hackers rifles? I’m sure that ended well.
  - Orbital DK

- Three supervisors, one political appointee and five of the hackers died, with seven wounded. The state police listed it as a mass suicide attempt. The State Assembly was briefly moved by the tragedy, but then realized they’d get a reduction in average salaries as the replacements didn’t have seniority.

This large-caliber rifle utilizes the classic .45-70 Government cartridge, making it ideal for hunting larger North American game, and is powerful enough to handle most Awakening-related problems an outdoorsman is likely to encounter. The reinforced polymer frame is designed to endure years of rough handling in the woods, while the improved double-link system ensures a smooth cycling action.

- The only place I’ve seen these was up in the Algonkian-Manitou Council region. But then, it seemed almost everyone was carrying one of these or something bigger. I never did spend much time in the wild up there.
  - Traveler Jones

- They are primarily used as hunting rifles now. The cartridge was developed for military use a couple hundred years ago, back when black powder was the primary propellant.
  - Beaker

- Black powder? I thought that stuff was only in the boring history trids. Unless we’re talking about last month’s street drug of choice.

A modern bolt-action rifle intended for the big-game hunter, the X71 has been thoroughly redesigned to meet the grueling requirements of arctic environments. The rifle’s self-diagnostic program is not as versatile as those offered through smartlink technology, but the simplicity lessens the chance of a malfunction. It’s simple-to-read ammunition counter allows the shooter to quickly determine their status when hunting dangerous prey, ensuring the hunter will not become the hunted.

- Bolt-action? Boring, can we get back to the fun guns please?
  - Slamm-0!

- I hate to agree with the chubby decker, but this is a knock-off of a Remington with a few minor mods so it won’t freeze in the snow.
  - Kane

- Actually this is a common rifle for the citizens up in the Athabaskan Council. The cold-weather modifications you are mocking can mean the difference between life and death there.
  - Traveler Jones

- If that is the case I’d prefer something with a larger magazine capacity, or failing that a harder punch.

:   Vintage, Cap & Ball

A reproduction of a two century old weapon, the 1855 has remained popular with the re-enactors of North America. While the hobby is not as popular as it was at the turn of the century, Springfield has licensed production to a number of smaller firms across the continent.

The quality of the rifle-muskets sold through Springfield’s Matrix storefront has been guaranteed by our gunsmiths for reliability and accuracy.

- I know somebody who has two of these, and he even keeps some black powder in the garage. Now I doubt he has any balls (of the lead kind), but the bayonet is no joke.
  - Hard Exit

- The re-enacting hobby is more common in the CAS than the UCAS. It probably has to do with mocking commentary from the press and lack of American Civil War history classes in the primary education programs.
  - Snopes

- I doubt any of us will see one of these anywhere but on a wage slave’s wall, but it is something to keep in mind when we become the police chase/shootout news bulletin. If they have it and you break in, they might try to use it against the “bloodthirsty terrorist.”

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Vintage

A modern remake of a classic rifle, the Springfield 2003 is a hunter’s dream come true. The bolt action is now computer verified to be within tolerance, and it utilizes the latest in laser-measuring tools. Sporting a chrome-plated bore and barrel, this weapon’s careful craftsmanship maintains a level of precision in manufacturing normally reserved for sniper weapons developed for elite Special Forces teams. The modern, composite furniture eliminates the one major problem with such heirloom firearms, which is that the wood used on the originals often ages poorly with use. The latest version is meant to last multiple lifetimes, as the composite has been fully tested for dependability and resiliency.

- Where did you find this advertisement? Springfield Arms stopped making this nearly forty years ago. I can’t even find a decent pricing guide on one.
  - Slamm-0!

- There is a small gunsmith shop just outside of Tallahassee that hand-makes them to order. You just need to know who to talk to, and what type of rum gets your order sped up.
  - Kane

- They’re fairly common in rural communities in the CAS. They’re accurate, long-ranged, and fairly heavy hitting for medium-sized targets. I just wouldn’t want to run into an Awakened critter with only a bolt-action rifle.

A classic North American hunting rifle evolved from a century-old military design, Springfield is happy to announce a new manufacturing partner for this historically significant rifle. Our current partner has updated the rifle to accept modern attachments to meet the needs of today’s shooters, including an advanced imaging sight designed to link with the shooter’s PAN, helping with accuracy and eliminating missed opportunities on hunting trips. Interested customers should contact their local dealer for availability or purchase direct from our Matrix store. Please be advised, due to strong demand, Matrix orders will require three weeks for delivery.

- A quality American firearm, courtesy of a Monobe International owned factory in Shandong. It seems the PPG is finding new ways of expanding their markets.
  - Baka Dabora

- It might not be manufactured in North America, but it’s pretty well made and accurate enough to double as a sniper rifle for lower-priced mercenaries.
  - Marcos

- Monobe picked up the facility, labor, and Springfield’s rusting machine tools for a song. Now they’re using the profits from their limited arms sales to upgrade this product and improve their cash position.

This classic intermediate-caliber rifle has been updated to reflect the needs of today’s hunter. The lever-action has been updated by utilizing modern materials, including titanium alloy in those areas requiring the greatest torsion strength. The chamber has been coated with easy-to clean polymers without reducing its ability to withstand the pressures created by ATF-approved propellants.

- Most collectors prefer weapons built before 2050. Apparently the extractor is stronger in the older rifles. As far as I can tell they shoot about the same.
  - Beaker

- It’s one of those funny things about wage slaves—they believe what they see on the Matrix. I doubt anyone here would care about whether a brass case lands one meter or three meters away from them—for our purposes it normally doesn’t matter.
  - Hard Exit

- That is a good point about this rifle and the Springfield 2003.They are only made for traditional cased rounds; nobody manufactures the rifle or bullets with a case less option.
  - Beaker

- You mean normal people aren’t worried about leaving forensic evidence behind? I find that unlikely <sarcasm off>.

This the latest update to “The Gun that Won the West.” It has been re-engineered to handle the chamber pressures of modern propellants and to meet current safety code. The rifle still uses classic calibers for traditional shootists and competitions, but has been also improved to utilize a number of modern cartridges for those who desire standardization in their collections. Available in a number of different sub-models; please refer to our Matrix catalog prior to purchase.

- I found it interesting when I was researching the selections here that the Model 2067 is more popular in the NAN than it is in UCAS. Winchester is shipping almost three times as many units for exports as they are guns for internal consumption.
  - Glitch

- The rifle is fun to shoot, but I wouldn’t want to use it in a combat situation. Shooting targets is one thing, but having to reload this when it counts would be a bear.
  - Hard Exit

- I’m not so sure they’re a bad choice, depending on the opponent. Some kook kept a Knight Errant SWAT team at bay with one of these and a pistol of the same caliber. It helped, I should add, that he was packing nearly two thousand rounds of ammunition.
