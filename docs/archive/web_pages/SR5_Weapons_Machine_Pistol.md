Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Electronic Firing, Laser Sight, Folding Stock

Utilizing the latest in projectile development, this surprisingly controllable lightweight automatic is capable of providing suppressive fire under nearly any circumstances. The slanted magazine reduces the number of jams due to magazine spring malfunction, while the integrated laser sight ensures the user sees exactly where they are aiming. The electronic firing mechanism ensures the complete combustion of the caseless propellant while reducing the perceived recoil to the firer. When fitted with its standard folding stock, the Evanator can serve as the primary weapon in a close-quarter engagement.

- It’s nearly impossible to carry this thing concealed without a shoulder strap—the manufacturer’s approved holster leaves a huge bump anyone can identify as a concealed weapon.
  - Fianchetto

- I guess that depends on the size of your frame to begin with. But I’m not worrying about this one any more—I tried it out briefly, but the lack of penetrative power had me switch away from it soon afterwards.
  - Mihoshi Oni

- I know someone selling cases of these cheap if you’re looking to arm a group up quick. But you’ll need to source the ammo on your own.
  - Marcos

- And how much to remove all the RFID tags and ROM chips an electronic gun like this always comes with. I’m sure the diagnostics program comes with a handy GPS interface to help you track climate-based malfunctions and all the telltale evidence that it leaves behind.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Smartlink

The Military 100 offers accurate automatic fire on a large-pistol frame. Fianchetti’s engineers have integrated a full spectrum smartlink sensor into the weapon’s frame, increasing accuracy in semi-automatic and fully automatic operation. The model features a rigid, reinforced polymer frame with fully integrated diagnostic sensors linked to the smartlink’s data transfer protocols, ensuring the operator full access to their weapon’s status at all times.

- Not very effective against armor—did the designers have something against SINless people or Barrens dwellers or whatever? It seems designed to handle unarmored opponents more than military personnel.
  - Slamm-0!

- I doubt there will be many calls for real military conflict soon. The Aztlan/Amazonia thing showed how random results of that can be, and how destructive to things governments and corporations value. But there is always a call to shove the masses back into their place.
  - Aufheben

- This is not a new development or anything. The lack of armor penetration has always been a problem for machine pistols. Generally the ability to make a small weapon controllable in automatic modes requires smaller rounds.
  - Hard Exit

Standard upgrades
: Folding stock, laser sight

A boxy machine pistol that comes from the factory with a laser sight, collapsible stock, and no iron sights for a snag-free draw. It uses cased ammunition only. This Saeder-Krupp weapon is popular with bodyguards and smaller security companies due to the ease of legally acquiring it. The strong bullpup mechanism ejects the spent shells up and to the right, making it slightly less popular with left-handed users.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
: Sound Suppressor

The first modern automatic pistol design offered by Remington, the Suppressor is intended for paramilitary organizations and government agencies requiring compact automatic weapons. The design integrates a number of European stylistic elements with modern automated manufacturing quality control methods, resulting in finely tuned tolerances intended to allow the user to accurately engage any target. The weapon is shipped with a detachable sound suppressor, allowing the user to reduce their audio signature at the expense of concealment.

- The pistol is decent but not outstanding. I found it comfortable the one time I carried it, but I prefer the Ares Crusader II for its gas-vent.
  - Hard Exit

- I’ve had a hard time keeping them in stock since I managed to find a supplier. There are a number of small gangs and criminal organizations creating a decent demand for it right now.
  - Red Anya

- The heavier round helps put down the opposition, but I’m not fond of a weapon I can’t suppress hostiles with.

Standard upgrades
: Gas-vent 2, laser sight

Originally designed for clandestine operation, the lack of wireless systems from the firearm makes it popular for concealed carry. With an integrated laser sight and gas-vent system, it is accurate and easy to control in burst fire, but it also has the capacity to suppress opponents for a short time. Ultimax continues to have a lack of modern (read: wireless) accessories factory installed, but it offers a host of after-market modifications.
While professional spies scoff at this weapon for being too large for true clandestine work, it is a nice alternative to the Ares Predator as an everyday carry piece for shadowrunners. Sometimes you just have to make everyone drop for a few seconds to make all the difference.
