## Bug Scanner (Rating 1-6)

| Also called a radio signal scanner, this device locates and locks in wireless devices within 20 meters. The scanner can also measure a signal’s strength and pinpoint its location. To operate a bug scanner, roll Electronic Warfare + Logic [Rating]. A device that is running silent (like a Stealth tag) can use its Logic + Sleaze to defend against the scan. If you get any net hits at all, you find the device. Wireless: You may substitute the scanner’s Rating for your Electronic Warfare skill when you use it. |

## Data Tap

| You use this hacking tool by attaching it to a data cable. Once it’s clamped onto the cable, you can use it via universal data connector. Any device directly connected to the data tap also has a direct connection with the devices on either end of the cable and vice versa. The tap can be removed without damaging the cable. Wireless: The data-tap can be wirelessly commanded to self-destruct as a Free Action, immediately and instantly severing the direct connection. This does not harm the cable. |

## Headjammer (Rating 1-6)

| The headjammer is used by security personnel to neutralize implanted commlinks. When it’s attached to your head (or other body part) and activated, it works in the same way as any other jammer, with its effects limited to you and your augmentations. Removing a headjammer from someone without the proper key requires a Hardware + Logic [Mental] or a Locksmith + Agility [Physical] (8, 1 Complex Action) Extended Test. Removing a Headjammer from yourself without the proper key is an Escape Artist + Agility [Physical] (4) Test, requiring a Complex Action. |

## Jammer, Area (Rating 1-6)

| This device floods the airwaves with electromagnetic jamming signals to block out wireless and radio communication. The jammer generates noise equal to its Device Rating. The area jammer affects a spherical area—its rating is reduced by 1 for every 5 meters from the center (similar to the blast rules for grenades). The jammer only affects devices (and personas on those devices) that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them. Walls and other obstacles may prevent the jamming signal from spreading or reduce its effect (gamemaster’s discretion). Wireless: You can set your jammer to not interfere with devices and personas you designate. |

## Jammer, Directional (Rating 1-6)

| This device floods the airwaves with electromagnetic jamming signals to block out wireless and radio communication. The jammer generates noise equal to its Device Rating. The directional jammer affects a conical area with a 30-degree spread—its rating is reduced by 1 for every 20 meters from the center. The jammer only affects devices (and personas on those devices) that are within the jamming area, but it affects all of them. Walls and other obstacles may prevent the jamming signal from spreading or reduce its effect (gamemaster’s discretion). Wireless: You can set your jammer to not interfere with devices and personas you designate. |

## Micro-Transceiver

| This classic short-range communicator has been favored by professional operatives since the 2050s. It doesn’t do anything special, it just lets you communicate by voice with other micro-transceivers and commlinks that you (and the other person) choose, within a kilometer. The micro-transceiver consists of an ear bud and an adhesive , both of which are commonly available in hard-to-spot designs. Wireless: The micro-transceiver’s range becomes worldwide. |

## Tag Eraser

| This handheld device creates a strong electromagnetic field perfect for burning out RFID tags and other unshielded electronics. It is probably strong enough to destroy a commlink, and you might want to keep it away from your cyberdeck just in case. When you bring the eraser within 5 millimeters of an electronic device and push the button, the device takes 10 boxes of Matrix damage (resisted normally). The extremely short range makes it hard to use on targets like vehicles, most drones, maglocks, and cyberware (and by the time you open them up to get at the electronics, you’ve already done plenty of damage). The tag eraser has one charge but can be fully recharged at a power point in 10 seconds. Wireless: The tag eraser recharges fully in an hour by induction. |

## White Noise Generator (Rating 1-6)

| This device creates a field of random noise, masking the sounds within its area and preventing direct audio surveillance. All Perception Tests to overhear a conversation within (Rating) meters of a white noise generator receive a negative dice pool modifier equal to the generator’s Rating. If more than one generator is in use, only count the highest rating. A white noise generator is redundant in a noisy environment (such as a nightclub or a firefight) and does not help to curtail video surveillance or jam wireless signals. Wireless: The white noise generator’s effective radius is tripled. |
