| Many of the Negative Metagenic Qualities provide serious social issues for characters since they look so strange. In a world of cookie-cutter corporate employees and ever-present surveillance, being different makes you stick out like a pink mohawk at a black trench coat convention. That, and everybody looks at you like you have two heads—which may well be one of the things you have. Getting down to chrome tacks, what this means is every time you take a quality that mentions this sidebar, you face a –1 dice pool modifier for all Social based tests, and for every three qualities, your Social limit decreases by 1. That’s the straight rules mechanic, but what does it mean to a character? Well, the character is going to be treated like an outsider or an eyesore, no matter where they go. Staring will be expected, whispers and pointing will occur, and frequent jeers are par for the course. Certain aspects of a characters freakish appearance may draw violent attention to them from more than just Humanis schmucks. Many changelings who ended up with insectoid or draconic features have suffered from the bug spirit attention (since the bugs often assume them to be rivals) and attacks from dragon-haters during the dragon civil war, pushing them to go into hiding. Some who hid poorly ended up being killed for their appearance alone. |

SURGE can happen to anyone and anything. Creating a changeling character requires the player to choose a level of SURGE: Class I (10 Karma), Class II (15 Karma), or Class III (30 Karma). The chosen class indicates the Karma limit of chosen metagenic qualities and determines the variability of SURGE characteristics for the character. Select one of three class options to determine the actual Karma cost of this variation. The three options are based on how much control a player wants in the effects of the character’s SURGE. Players with Class III characters get to select the full range of qualities, both positive and negative, for the character. Players with Class II characters select the Positive Qualities to the Karma level of their choice; they then must roll Negative Qualities randomly to balance out the Positive Qualities selected. Players with Class I characters select all qualities randomly. They initially should roll random Positive Qualities until they have what they believe to be a sufficient amount (maximum Karma value of these qualities is 30). They then randomly roll Negative Qualities to balance out the Positive Qualities.

When a player selects Positive and Negative Metagenic Qualities, the combined Karma values need to either balance exactly or err in favor of a single point of Karma on the Positive Quality side of the balance; the player must pay for the imbalance with Karma from their free Karma pool.

Gamemasters are allowed some leeway when it comes to selecting metagenic qualities for an NPC. She can either select the ones she would like the character to have for the purposes of story, campaign, or character background, or she can roll on the Metagenic Qualities Table.

In any case, the player or gamemaster has to remember the general rule of each Class of SURGE. Class I SURGE can be totally random but is limited to metahuman and minor animal qualities; there is no need to connect the Positive and Negative Qualities to the same metatype or animal classification. Class II SURGE is more diverse and includes traits found outside the metahuman spectrum; again there is no need to connect Positive and Negative Qualities, though it tends to be more likely. Class III SURGE runs the gamut, though the majority have traits that all reflect a similar theme, such as catperson, lizardperson, birdperson, etc.; thus the Positive and Negative Qualities should all relate to the overall theme.

## 360-degree Eyesight

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

This quality provides the character with a 360-degree field of vision. Whether this is due to a repositioning and/or composition of the eyes is up to the player or gamemaster to determine. The ocular structure and system does need to have a natural counterpart such as an insect’s compound eyes or chameleon eyes situated on either side of the head. The character gains a +1 dice pool modifier on vision-based Perception Tests and Surprise Tests. This isn’t a perfect system, and the metahuman brain is not designed to process 360 degrees of vision. Characters face a –1 dice pool modifier to any tests while in motion, possibly negating other modifiers, and a –1 dice pool modifier when making a Ranged Attack Test at distances greater than 10 meters. These modifiers are cumulative. 360-Degree Vision cannot be augmented and is incompatible with eye replacement.
Characters with this quality will normally incur social modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Animal Pelage

| **COST** :3 TO 5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A character with this quality develops hair follicles that grow an unusual fur, or pelage. This hair has not only cosmetic functions like Unusual Hair (p. 122) but an environmental benefit as well. Animal Pelage counts as Unusual Hair (p. 122) for rules purposes as well. Some possible options are listed here, but gamemasters and players are encouraged to come up with their own if they want, keeping in mind the natural counterpart requirement.

Quills (5 Karma)
: These modified hairs are coated with thick keratin plates that resemble porcupine quills, interspersed with bristles, under fur and hair. Quills are 2 to 4 centimeters long, sharp as needles, and detach easily when used in close combat. Quills are used as a defensive mechanism to hold off attackers. If the character is successfully grappled in close combat (see Subduing, p. 195, SR5), the attacker makes a Damage Resistance Test against a DV of (STR + 1)P, AP +1, using the higher Strength attribute of the grappling pair. Quills can be wielded in melee combat using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Quills) skill, with the following stats: DV (STR + 1)P, Reach —, AP +1. The character’s arms or legs must be exposed and mobile to use any of these advantages. Quills is incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

Insulating Pelt (4 Karma)
: This is a thick insulating pelt of fur covering the entire body. Pelts insulate the wearer from cold and immersion in water, providing characters with this quality a +2 dice pool modifier for Survival Tests in frigid environments (such as Arctic and Subarctic regions) and +4 Armor against Cold-based attacks. Characters face a –2 dice pool modifier for Survival Tests in extreme heat environments. Clothing and armor can be worn normally over this hair. Insulating Pelt is incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

Camo Fur (3 Karma)
: Covered by dark or patterned fur, the character receives a +1 dice pool modifier for Sneaking Tests in any condition with decreased light levels and in environments appropriate to the pattern (stripes in tall grass, spots in a forest or jungle, etc.).

Camo Fur is incompatible with other natural or artificial hair or skin modifications.

## Arcane Arrester

| **COST** :10 KARMA PER LEVEL (MAX 2) | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

When targeted by a spell (including a critter’s Innate Spell), the character is harder to affect. This potent ability makes casting both benevolent and malevolent spells on these characters much more difficult. The character adds (Level x 2) dice to their resistance test against any spell. If the spell is one that is not normally resisted (such as Invisibility), the character still rolls their Arcane Arrester dice pool of either two or four dice and reduces the hits rolled on the Spellcasting Test by any hits they roll. For instance, if a mage casts Invisibility on a character with Arcane Arrester 2 and gets 4 hits on a Spellcasting Test, the target character rolls 4 dice and gets 2 hits, meaning only two of the hits on the Spellcasting Test are used to make the target invisible. Arcane Arrester cannot be combined with Magic Resistance (p. 76, SR5). This quality can be taken by characters with a Magic attribute, and it affects spells they cast on themselves.

## Balance Receptor

| **COST** :6 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

This statocyst-like balance receptor works in conjunction with mammalian semicircular canals, augmenting balance. The balance receptor provides characters with this quality a +1 dice pool modifier to tests involving balance. This includes Agility-based Tests to maintain balance, Climbing Tests, Jumping Tests, and all Gymnastics Tests. This is incompatible with cyberears and the balance augmenter augmentation.

## Beak

| **COST** :3 OR 5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Instead of a mouth and nose, the middle and lower parts of the character’s face are replaced by a beak and nostrils. The beak can vary in size, shape, and function, much like their natural counterparts. The beak is not the only avian quality the character gains. As beaks cannot be used for chewing, characters with beaks swallow each bite whole, and the food is then processed by a gizzard constructed of thick, muscular walls that grind up food. This quality expands the range of substances the character can eat and reduces Lifestyle costs by 10 percent. The extra organ also provides a +1 dice pool modifier on tests to resist ingested toxins (see Toxins, p. 408, SR5).

Characters with the Beak quality (including Raptor Beak) suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

Raptor Beak (5 Karma)
: Where a standard beak is not designed for combat, this beak is. It can be used with the Unarmed Combat Skill ((STR + 2)P, Reach –1, AP –2).

## Bicardiac

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality possess a second heart located in the right half of their torso. This second heart augments the normal heart in maintaining the cardiovascular system. Bicardiac characters can perform strenuous exercise for longer periods of time due to increased blood supply and higher pulse rates that would cause tachycardia in normal people. They double the fatigue damage interval for strenuous activities, such as running, sprinting, and operating in hot or cold environments (see Fatigue Damage, p. 172, SR5). Bicardiac is compatible with synthacardium, though only the primary heart can be augmented.

## Biosonar

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality possess all the natural organs for a sophisticated biological echolocation system similar to those of a bat or dolphin. They can emit ultrasonic calls and form a mental image of the surrounding space from the echoes that bounce off their surroundings. Creating an image requires spending a Free Action (Speak) to emit the noise; the action provides an instant picture of the area out to fifty meters that can be used for Attack or vision-based Perception Tests. This system cannot perceive changes that occur between emissions, but it can detected changes through regular Perception Tests. The biological systems for this ability change the shape and size of the character’s outer and inner ears and vocal cords. Ear shape changes provide a +1 dice pool modifier to audio-based Perception Tests and result in a +1 DV modifier to all sonic-based attacks made against the character.

## Bone Spikes

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Razor-sharp bony deposits grow from the character’s skeletal structure and poke through the skin. Characters with Bone Spikes cannot wear armor or restrictive clothing because the protruding bone spurs make it too uncomfortable. Armor and clothing can be specially designed for the character and purchased at a fifty percent increase to the base cost. The spikes also make the character more dangerous in melee combat, and unarmed melee damage for this character is (STR + 2)P.

## Broadened Auditory Spectrum

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

**(ULTRASOUND OR INFRASOUND)**

This quality enables the character to hear outside the range of normal metahuman hearing. They can either hear ultrasonic, high-frequency sound (including ultrasound emitters) or infrasonic, low-frequency sound. The character must choose which kind of frequency they can hear upon selecting the quality, and the quality may be selected twice, once for each frequency. They cannot choose or control any particular frequency within the selected spectrum. This ability allows the character to make a Perception Test to detect communication or sounds within his chosen frequency band and adds +1 to the limit of Perception Tests involving sound. As this kind of hearing can be considered always on, noises inaudible to others may sometimes distract or deafen the character. This quality results in minor visible changes to the size and structure of the outer ear.

Broadened Auditory Spectrum is incompatible with any earware (p. 453, SR5).

## Camouflage

| **COST** :4 OR 8 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

This quality provides characters with skin and hair pigmentation that can change to adopt the coloration of a background, much like a chameleon.

Camouflage is incompatible with any other dermal modification, and characters with the Camouflage quality suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

Basic Camouflage (4 Karma)
: The character’s skin changes color only when exposed for a prolonged time (1 minute) to a background with sharp contrasts, like colorful patterns, and it retains the new color for up to 4 hours total. If the background around it changes, the color fades and the creature’s coloration returns to normal within 10 minutes. While the camouflage is in effect, increase the threshold to see the character by 2, as long as they are standing still and not wearing clothing that would ruin the camouflage effect.

Dynamic Coloration (8 Karma)
: The character’s skin changes color slowly with the background, even as the character moves. This imposes a minus 2 to the visual perception test to see the character while moving and a minus 4 if stationary; the character can not be wearing any clothing that would ruin the camouflage effect.
: Even when clothed, any exposed skin will change with the background.

## Celerity

| **COST** :6 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

This quality results in a strengthening of the musculature involved in running, causing leg muscles to become ropy and more prominent. The character increases her Walking and Running rates to Agility x 3 (Walking) and Agility x 6 (Running) and also adds +1m/ turn to her Sprint Increase (see Movement, p. 161, SR5). This quality cannot be combined with any leg- or muscle-altering system (i.e., cyberlimbs, muscle replacement, muscle toner, muscle augmentation) and is also incompatible with Satyr Legs.

## Claws

| **COST** :3, 5, OR 7 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s fingernails and toenails harden and lengthen into claws.

Digging Claws (3 Karma)
: These claws provide a +2 dice pool modifier to all tests involving digging or moving earth, but they aren’t as effective in combat (Unarmed Çombat skill, DV (STR)P, Reach —, AP +1). This quality is incompatible with any cyberweapon or limb replacement cyberware.

Razor Claws (5 Karma)
: These claws may be used to attack an opponent using the Unarmed Combat skill. Razor claws have a DV of (STR + 1)P, AP –1.

Retractable Claws (7 Karma)
: Retractable claws have the same effect as Razor Claws, but they can be retracted and hidden. Digging claws cannot be retracted.

## Climate Adaptation

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

**(CHOOSE DESERT OR ARCTIC CLIMATE)**
The character’s metabolic processes, skin tissue, and regulation cycles are adapted to extreme heat or cold climates, enabling the character to adjust more easily to hot or cold temperatures. This quality grants a +1 dice pool modifier for Survival Tests (p. 136, SR5) and resisting fatigue damage (see p. 172, SR5) from their chosen environment and a –1 dice pool modifier from the other. The player must select a climate when choosing this quality. Climate Adaptation is not compatible with dermal plating, any skin modifications, or a suprathyroid gland.

## Corrosive Spit

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses salivary glands like certain paracritters that possess the Corrosive Spit power. To strike an intended target, the character makes a Ranged Attack Test using the Exotic Ranged Weapon (Corrosive Spit) + Agility [Physical], with a range of (Body) meters. The saliva causes Acid damage (p. 170, SR5), with a DV of 6P. As the saliva must be replenished, this type of attack can only be used once every thirty minutes.

## Dermal Alteration

| **COST** :3 TO 15 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality possess skin that looks and feels quite different from normal skin and has unique properties. Dermal Alteration is incompatible with any other natural or artificial skin modification.

Bark Skin (5 Karma)
: This skin contains woven cellulose fibers and wooden filaments that make it resemble tree bark in appearance and hardness. Bark Skin confers +2 armor and is cumulative with any worn armor.

Blubber (3 Karma)
: This skin possesses a thick layer of vascularized fat underneath the surface that acts as an thermal insulator. The character receives a +2 armor bonus when resisting Cold damage, but he also suffers a –2 dice pool modifier to Perception Tests involving cold.

Dragon Skin (3 Karma)
: This skin forms a scaly hide that makes the character more heat resistant. The character receives a +2 armor when resisting Fire damage, but she also suffers a –2 dice pool modifier to Perception Tests involving heat.

Granite Shell (15 Karma)
: This skin contains massive calcite formations that make it appear grayish and hard as rock. Granite Shell provides +4 armor that functions as Hardened Armor (p. 397, SR5) but is not fully stackable with other worn armor. For Damage Resistance Tests; though Granite Shell does not stack with worn armor it does still provide 2 automatic hits from the Hardened Armor (p. 397, SR5).

Rhino Hide (7 Karma)
: This skin is hard, thick, and leathery like an elephant’s or rhinoceros’s. Rhino Hide grants +3 armor and is cumulative with any worn armor.

## Dermal Deposits

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Tough dermal deposits under or on the skin, similar to a troll, count as a natural +1 armor, which is cumulative with worn armor. If a troll changeling acquires this quality, his dermal deposits become even more widespread and pronounced, making the +1 bonus from this quality cumulative with their +1 armor bonus

## Defensive Secretion

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s skin cells that allow her to exude a defensive liquid when agitated or endangered, similar to the defensive secretions of frogs. Though not poisonous, these secretions are either acidic, creating a burning sensation upon touch, or cause other adverse skin reactions. As soon as another person touches the bare skin of the agitated character with unprotected skin, that person suffers a –1 dice pool modifier for all tests made within the next 24 hours or until treated with a successful Medicine + Logic [Mental] (2) Test. Defensive Secretion does not work against spirits.

## Electroception

| **COST** :4 OR 7 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality have developed the capacity to sense electricity and changes to electrical fields in their vicinity. The ability allows the character to use an Observe in Detail Simple Action to make a Perception + Intuition [Mental] Test. Hits on the test are compared to the Electroception Table to determine results. The range of Electroception is (Essence) meters

Electrosense (4 Karma)
: Similar to animals like fish or platypuses, the character has developed electroreceptor organs to detect electromagnetic fields. While current electronic devices have optical processors, they still require electrical energy in order to function, and that energy generates an electric field.

Technosense (7 Karma)
: In a still-unknown organic process, the character can sense the higher energies of wireless technology like technomancers. While the character can sense wireless signals, they cannot manipulate them.

Noise modifiers affect this Perception Test.

## Elongated Limbs

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s arms and legs are elongated, granting her a greater effective reach. Characters with this trait gain Reach +1. This quality is cumulative with any existing Reach modifier. The character must buy special clothing and armor to accommodate this unusual physique at a ten percent cost increase. If the character tries to use ill-fitting armor, the armor rating is reduced by 10 percent (round up).

## Fangs

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s canine teeth are enlarged and sharpened like a carnivore’s. The fangs can be used to attack using the Unarmed Combat skill (DV (STR +1)P, Reach –1, AP —).

## Frog Tongue

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses a long adhesive tongue, which can be extended in a spring-loaded fashion by a muscular trigger. When triggered, it shoots outward to strike at a target and then retracts. Though not prehensile enough to manipulate a tool, the tongue is strong enough to snatch an object, provided the object’s weight is less than the character’s unaugmented Strength x 100 grams. Because of the tongue’s sticky secretions, the object will stick to the tongue until manually removed. If the character also possesses the Natural Venom quality (p. 117) the tongue can be used to apply the substance with a successful touch-only melee attack (p. 187, SR5) using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Frog Tongue) skill.

## Functional Tail

| **COST** :4 TO 7 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A tail grows from the base of the character’s spine; this may be scaly (like a lizard), hairy (like a monkey), or hairless (like an opossum’s tail), and it is fully developed and functional, unlike the Vestigial Tail (p. 123).

The character’s clothing must accommodate the tail to gain any of the above effects. Sitting in certain positions for long periods of time will be uncomfortable and cause a –1 dice pool modifier to all actions while the character is sitting on his tail. The Functional Tail quality is incompatible with any other tail modification or quality. Characters with the Functional Tail quality suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

Balance (6 Karma)
: Usually between one and two meters long, a tail used for balance is not under the character’s conscious control. Instead, it functions instinctively by twitching, swaying, and even wrapping around things at random in order to improve the character’s balance. Characters with a balance tail receive a +1 dice pool modifier for all Balance, Climbing, Gymnastics, or Jumping-related tests.

Paddle (4 Karma)
: This broad and scaly beaver-like tail can be used to steer and paddle when swimming, granting a +2 dice pool modifier for all Swimming Tests.

Prehensile (7 Karma)
: This tail functions like the Balance tail, except that the character can consciously manipulate it as if it were an extra limb. The tail can pick up items, though it lacks digits and has difficulty with fine manipulation. Apply a –4 dice pool modifier to any attempt at fine manipulation of an object with the tail, such as pressing a button or pulling a trigger. The tail has an effective Strength equal to half the character’s unaugmented Strength (round down), but it can hold the character’s entire body weight if he chooses to hang from it. Prehensile tails do not provide an extra attack.

Thagomizer (5 Karma)
: This powerfully muscled prehensile tail ends in an array of dermal spikes and can be used for a melee attack using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Thagomizer) skill, with the following stats: DV (STR + 3) P, Reach 1, AP –1.

## Gills

| **COST** :4 OR 6 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Amphibian-like gills allow the character to breathe underwater. These can be located on the side of the neck, on the pectoral region, or beneath the armpits. The character’s respiratory and circulatory systems allow her to reflexively alternate between using lungs and gills as necessary. These gills develop in varying levels of functionality representing the difference in Karma cost. For 4 Karma the character has either Air or Aqua Gills, chosen when the quality is taken. These gills aren’t perfect, and Fatigue Test durations are halved in either air (for aqua gills) or water (for air gills). For 6 Karma, the gills function equally well, without penalty, in either environment.

## Glamour

| **COST** :12 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A character with Glamour is paranaturally gifted so that all sapient beings perceive him as moving with unearthly grace. His countenance always seems radiant, and his voice is soul wrenching and laden with emotion. People may describe him as angelic or fairylike, and everyone he speaks to cannot help but feel moved and inspired. Sapient beings always respond with awe, deference, and kindness to the character as long as he does not act hostile. The character adds 2 to his Social limit and has a +1 dice pool modifier to all Social Skill Tests, with the exception of Intimidation. This quality renders the character particularly memorable, and he suffers from the effects of Distinctive Style quality (p.80, SR5).

## Goring Horns

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A single horn or horns express on the character’s head. If the character already had horns, these grow even bigger or more pronounced. The horns can be anything from ram horns to deer-like antlers to devil horns or even jagged crests of bone around the skull. Unlike most metatype horns, the character may use these in combat with the Exotic Melee Weapon (Horns) skill. Goring Horns have the following stats: DV (STR + 2)P, Reach —, AP –1.

## Greasy Skin

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s skin contains sweat glands that produce a greasy lubricant in stressful or exhausting situations, covering the body with an oily film that gives it a moist sheen. While it does not impair the character’s normal actions, the lubricant makes the character harder to grapple. Subduing melee attacks against the character face a –2 dice pool modifier as long as more than half the character’s body is exposed. Greasy Skin is incompatible with extensive body hair or skin modifications or qualities.

## Keen-eared

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality have extraordinarily keen hearing due to overly large ears. A character with this quality gains a +1 dice pool modifier to audio-based Perception Tests.

## Larger Tusks

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Larger tusks, bigger variants of normal metahuman tusks, resemble the tusks of elephants, warthogs, and walruses. As with Fangs (p. 115), a character can attack with these tusks using her normal Unarmed Combat skill (DV (STR + 2)P, Reach —, AP —). Larger Tusks are incompatible with mouth implants and modifications (except the Proboscis, p. 117). Characters with the Larger Tusks quality suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Low-light Vision

| **COST** :2 OR 4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses eyes that provide natural lowlight vision and enable her to see normally in light levels as low as starlight. Low-light vision cannot be combined with eye replacement.

Normal eyes resulting from the character’s metagenic background, such as elf or ork eyes, cost 4 Karma. Reflective feline eyes with slit irises cost 2 Karma and affect social interactions (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Magic Sense

| **COST** :7 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses the ability to detect the use of magic in his vicinity. The ability operates similar to a Detect Magic spell (p. 287, SR5), but use Intuition + Willpower [Astral] for the individual’s test instead of Spellcasting + Magic [Force]. The range of the ability equals (Magic x 5) meters, with a minimum range of 5 meters (including characters with no Magic Rating).

## Magnetoception

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Similar to Electrosense, Magnetoception allows a character to sense changes in nearby magnetic fields. This is accomplished by an elevated level of magnetite in the ethmoid bone of the nose and specialized neural pathways linking to a modified olfactory bulb and olfactory cortex. Characters with this quality can literally sniff out the presence, direction, and intensity of magnetic fields, such as those generated by electronics, power supplies, or magnetic anomaly detectors. The character also has an unerring ability to locate magnetic north, providing a +1 dice pool bonus to Navigation Tests. The character makes a Perception + Intuition [Mental] v Object Resistance Table (p. 293, SR5) to detect these emanations within a range of 5 meters.

## Marsupial Pouch

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character develops a pocket-like pouch on her chest or abdomen, just like the pouch a kangaroo uses to carry its young. This pouch is equivalent to a Smuggling Compartment with a Concealability modifier of –6 (p. 455, SR5).

## Metagenic (attribute) Improvement

| **COST** :15 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A character with Metagenic Improvement possesses a genetic expression that enhances the genes connected to the development of a certain Mental or Physical attribute. In game terms, the minimum and maximum values for one of the character’s attributes (as listed in the Metatype Attribute Table, p. 66, SR5) are both raised by 1. This quality may only be taken once per attribute, but it is cumulative with the Exceptional Attribute quality (p. 72, SR5).

## Metahuman Traits

| **COST** :2 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Characters with this quality possess metagenes that express as certain cosmetic metahuman traits (such as elongated ears, dwarfism, gigantism, or ork tusks). This quality grants a human character a +1 dice pool modifier when disguising herself as a member of the metatype she resembles (elf, dwarf, ork, or troll), similar to the Elf or Ork Poser qualities. This quality can only be taken by human characters.

## Monkey Paws

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses monkey- or chameleon-like gripping feet with elongated, prehensile toes that enable him to climb more easily when barefoot. Non-tumbling Gymnastics, Climbing, and Movement in Zero Gravity (p. 163, Run & Gun) tests gain a +2 dice pool modifier. If the character is not wearing shoes that accommodate this unusual physique, the dice pool modifier is reduced to +1.

## Nasty Vibe

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A character with this quality radiates the ultimate bad vibe. Sapient beings in her presence feel an indefinable air of menace, making them feel ill at ease and oppressed. Some might even describe the feeling as being in the presence of evil (regardless of whether this is true or not), and the superstitious might attribute the character’s nature to something demonic. The character gets a +2 dice pool modifier to all Intimidation Tests and any attempt to instill fear in a sapient target.

## Natural Venom

**ANIMAL TOXINS TABLE**

| SEVERITY | KARMA COST | SPEED         | POWER | EFFECT                                     | PENETRATION |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Mild     | 3          | 1 Combat Turn | 8     | Disorientation; Stun Damage                | 0           |
| Moderate | 5          | 1 Combat Turn | 12    | Disorientation; Nausea; Stun Damage        | –1          |
| Serious  | 10         | Immediate     | 10    | Disorientation; Paralysis; Physical Damage | –2          |
| Deadly   | 15         | Immediate     | 12    | Nausea; Paralysis; Physical Damage         | –2          |

| **COST** :3 TO 20 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s body produces a naturally occurring animal toxin (to which the character herself possesses complete immunity). Possible toxins can be found on the Animal Toxins Table. The toxin can be exhaled (Inhalation Vector, 3 Karma), spat (Contact Vector, 5 Karma), or injected (Injected Vector, 0 Karma, requires Fangs quality, p. 115). The Karma cost of this quality equals the sum of the Vector cost listed above and the costs and the Severity of the toxin chosen, as listed in the Animal Toxins table. For example, a Moderate injected venom costs 5 Karma, while a Serious spat venom costs 15 Karma. Natural Venom is incompatible with Corrosive Spit.

## Ogre Stomach

| **COST** :8 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s unique stomach, intestinal organs, and unusual gut flora can digest a variety of substances that normal metahumans cannot or have trouble digesting, such as raw meat and cellulose-based plant material, including grass. Lifestyle costs for this character are reduced by twenty percent, and the character receives a +2 dice pool modifier on Toxin Resistance Tests to resist ingested toxins (p. 408, SR5).

## Photometabolism

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses an organ, such as chloroplast skin or grasslike body hair, that supplements his energy needs via photosynthesis. Even when the character’s organ is fully exposed to sunlight, this process only creates enough nourishment for the recipient to supplement his diet, not to replace it. Characters with Photometabolism reduce their Lifestyle costs by ten percent. However, since the character’s overall physical well-being and energy increase in the sunlight, the character feels uncomfortable at night or in the shade, suffering a –1 dice pool penalty on all Social Tests. Photometabolism is incompatible with the Nocturnal quality (p. 121) and with all skin and hair modifications.

## Proboscis

| **COST** :5 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character possesses an prehensile nose or elephantine trunk instead of a typical nose and upper lip. This is even more versatile than the Prehensile Tail (p. 115). It can be used for small manipulations or even a blunt punch using the Exotic Melee Weapon (Trunk) skill (DV (STR – 1)P, Reach —, AP +1). Apply a –2 dice pool modifier to any attempt to manipulate an object with the trunk. It has an effective Strength equal to the character’s unaugmented Strength. Trunks do not provide an extra attack. Characters with a proboscis suffer modifiers to social interaction (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Satyr Legs

| **COST** :10 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s legs are shaped like a quadruped’s hind legs, often with cloven hooves, though other types such as kangaroo or hare legs are possible. The legs also grow more hair, like those of a satyr. A character with Satyr Legs increases her Running rate to (Agility x 6) and also adds +1m/turn to her Sprint increase (see Movement, p. 161, SR5). The legs also provide a +2 Strength modifier to the damage of any kicking attacks.

Characters with the Satyr Legs quality suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Setae

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Also known as gecko hands, these hairlike structures on a character’s palms allow the character to move along vertical surfaces just like certain reptilian species. Characters with this quality always use assisted climbing rates (p. 134, SR5) as long as their hands are exposed.

## Shiva Arms

| **COST** :8 KARMA PER PAIR | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Certain rare changelings and one metavariant grant a character an additional set of arms that extend from modified shoulder joints. The character may hold and carry double the number of objects than normal. These so-called Shiva arms or Kali arms can be moved independently, but the character will still have one dominant hand unless she has the Ambidextrous quality (p. 71, SR5), which can be taken multiple times, each time adding another dominant hand. Characters with Shiva Arms can wield multiple weapons: firearms, melee weapons, or a combination of the two. Weapons wielded in an off-hand suffer the usual penalty; this applies both to firearms and melee weapons (see the Melee Modifiers table, p. 187, SR5). The character can use the Multiple Attacks Free Action (p. 164, SR5) with firearms in their extra hands, though the character must still split her dice pool between the firearms, and any penalties for using firearms in their off-hands still apply.

This quality may be taken twice, for a total of six arms.
Characters with the Shiva Arms quality suffer social stigma and modifiers (see Freaks sidebar, p. 123).

## Thermal Sensitivity

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Like a snake, the character possesses infrared-sensitive receptors next to his olfactory organs that allow him to sense radiated heat. This quality allows the character to make a non-visual Perception Test to detect anything that produces heat (bodies, electronics, etc.) within ten meters. Thresholds and modifiers can be adjusted for factors such as warm environments, lower heat outputs (such as friction or decomposition), or heat pollution (too many sources, thermal smoke, etc.). Hits on the test give information on distance, movement, heat output, and location. The sense is not fooled by Invisibility or Silence spells. When using thermal sensitivity in combat, the sense reduces the Visibility and Light/ Glare modifiers by one level.

## Thermographic Vision

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

A character with this quality has natural thermographic vision, just like dwarfs and trolls.

## Thorns

| **COST** :2 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

Hard, sharp protrusions 1 centimeter long protrude through the character’s skin. These points resemble plant thorns. They are, in fact, a modified form of keratin growing naturally from a sub-dermal layer that painfully emerge from beneath the skin. They regrow over a few days if cracked or broken. Thorns make the character mildly more dangerous in unarmed combat. Add +1 to the DV of any Unarmed Combat attack. Unfortunately, the character is in constant discomfort due to the discomfort of the thorns, giving them –1 to all Physical Tests. The character must have clothing that accommodates her unusual physique and may require customization of certain gear (like armor), increasing the cost by 20–100 percent.

## Underwater Vision

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character develops an additional, specially adapted membrane to the outer eye that enables him to use his normal vision unrestricted in and out of water. This allows the character to use the underwater visibility modifiers (p. 157, Run & Gun) as if he were wearing goggles or a mask.

## Vomeronasal Organ

| **COST** :3 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character’s nose contains additional olfactory organelles that augment her sense of smell, granting a higher sensitivity and contrast by sending neural signals not only to the accessory olfactory bulb but also to the amygdala and hypothalamus. This enhances a metahuman’s innate ability to discern and react to individuals by scent, and also to detect basic emotional responses such as fear, anger, or lust. A character with this quality can also identify individual people and animals by their smell. Add a +2 dice pool modifier to any Perception Tests based on smell and a +1 dice pool modifier to all Social Tests when the character can smell her target. Strong odors and intense background smells (e.g., garbage, spicy foods, etc.) may diminish this ability or even confuse it, and the character may experience extreme discomfort when confronted with overwhelming odors (e.g., large crowds or offensive smells). To reflect distraction or discomfort, impose a –1 dice pool modifier to all tests in these situations (though a respirator can reduce these penalties by filtrating the air). Thanks to the neural connections between vomeronasal organs and the brain’s behavioral centers, tailored pheromones provide twice their normal bonus against characters with this quality. If the character also possesses an adrenaline pump (p. 459, SR5), other people’s smells of fear, anger, and lust may trigger the pump. In these cases, the character should make a Composure (2) Test (p. 152, SR5).

## Webbed Digits

| **COST** :4 KARMA | |
| **PREREQUISITES:** NONE |
| **RATING** :NONE |
| **SOURCE** :SR5:RF |

The character has webbed fingers and toes similar to a seal, duck, or frog. This provides a +2 dice pool modifier to all Swimming Tests but inflicts a –1 dice pool modifier to any fine manipulations using the webbed digits.
