There is an optional ruleset for building characters as described in SR5:RF, page 64. The process is as follows:

1. Beginning with 800 karma, purchase a [Metatype](/Shadowrun/index.php/SR5:Character_Creation:Metatype_List "SR5:Character Creation:Metatype List").

2. Optionally buy a quality to be able to use Magic or Resonance:
   1. Adept (20 karma)
   2. Aspected Magician (15 karma)
   3. Magician (30 karma)
   4. Mystic Adept (35 karma)
   5. Technomancer (15 karma)

3. Follow the normal steps of character creation, except buying the relevant pieces with karma and exchanging 1 karma for 2,000 nuyen as needed to purchase gear.
