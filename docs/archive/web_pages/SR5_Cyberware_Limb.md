In today’s world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and torsos are included in the “cyberlimbs” category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

Cyberlimbs have their own Strength and Agility ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb. The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and –feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand). Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity.

Cyberlimbs have other useful features. They give you 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet, and partial limbs count for half a limb). They have Capacity, letting you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost [in brackets]. They can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements. Cyberlimbs can be dangerous even if they don’t have cyberweapons installed— their unarmed Damage Value is (STR)P.

| ESSENCE | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| Cost and Availability Multiply by each STR and AGI point above 3 |  |
| All standard cyberlimbs come with Strength and Agility attributes of 3. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations. You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb’s base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb’s Availability and cost. If either of your limb’s attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can’t use the cyberlimb (so don’t overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can’t customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.Cyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic. |

# Obvious Limbs

These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellant and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

# Synthetic Limbs

Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they’re cybernetic gives them a –8 Concealability (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone’s just looking, but synthetic limbs are obviously artificial to the touch.

# Cyberlimb Enhancements

Cyberlimb enhancements use up to the Capacity of the cyberlimb they enhance. There are three types of enhancement: Agility, Armor, and Strength. Physical attribute enhancements add their Rating to the appropriate attribute of the limb. Armor enhancements provide an Armor bonus equal to their rating, cumulative with other armor, without adding to Encumbrance. Each limb can have only one enhancement of each type (you can’t stack two Strength 3 enhancements in the same cyberarm), but you can replace one you have with one you want.
