In 2075, you’d have to be crazy to consider walking outside with just a tee-shirt and jeans, even in some of the nicer parts of the Sprawl. You need protection: from the acid rain, from air pollution, from ultraviolet radiation from the completely fragged ozone layer, and of course, from random street violence.

Advances in ballistic fabrics from spiderweave venlar threads to ceramic-titanium composite plates enable modern armor to be lightweight, flexible, and concealable. For game rules dealing with armor, see p. 168.

| Clothing in 2075 comes with amazing features you’ll likely completely take for granted. Commlinks, music players, and other electronic devices can be woven right into the fabric, powered by interwoven batter ies or special energy-gather ing fabrics. On the other side of the economy, cheap soybased “flats” can be had for five nuyen per ar ticle of clothing from vending machines around the Sprawl. The more money you spend on your threads, the more impressive you look. |

| Wireless Changing your clothes’ settings is a Free Action, and while it’s not good enough to be camouflage, it can display images, text files, or flat video from your commlink. | |
| Electrochromic threads can change color with voltage, letting you alter the color of your clothing or display text, images, or patterns. This is good for fashion, but great for vanishing into a crowd if you need a quick costume change. You can even get armored clothing in electrochromic styles. It takes a Simple Action to change the settings on your electrochromic clothes, but a couple of Combat Turns to complete the change. |

## Mortimer of London

| High-end enough to get you into some of the nicestestablishments but not completely out of reach for theaverage runner. Netcat Problem is, this stuff has become almost a dead giveawayof runners working places that are outside their incomebracket. And on top of that, they have a high enoughresale value that wearing them makes you a target for thescum that live in your neighborhood. Mihoshi Oni I like the mix-n-match option Mortimer promotes,especially since their pieces can be mixed across yearswithout creating a total fashion faux-pas. Look for thisstuff on the resale market if you’re on a budget. It workswell with Armand’s “lightly worn” stock, too. Picador |

Not exactly fashion-forward, but classic enough to always stay near the height of fashion. Mortimer has stuck with the classics, anchored around the venerable Berwick line. All pieces are custom tailored and fit, and I especially love that they include custom tailoring to fit “exceptional physical aspects” of their individual customers. Original pieces have to be sat for with a Mortimer certified tailor.

I have a pretty solid stock of “lightly worn” Mortimer from some of his past lines. They lack the custom-cut features, but they can still have the important effect of making you look classier than you really are. The Crimson Sky and Summit lines from back in the early ’60s have aged quite well. And though they lack some of the wireless perks of many modern armors, they still stop bullets.

## Vashon Island

| To remind those who aren’t old … err … don’t remember, here’s the descriptions from the original line: Ace of Spades featured a WWII US fighter pilot style, Ace of Clubs went across the ocean for a WWII British bomber pilot style, Ace of Hearts updated the concept to a modern military pilot style, and Ace of Diamonds went into the future with designs based on the Spitfire Resurrection trid series. /dev/grrl I liked Spitfire Res. Too bad what happened to the lead actor. Sticks Yup, too bad. ;) Matt Wrath These new Aces lines may not fit in with the tarot line, but as you might guess, the public doesn’t really care. The styles are catching on with a large audience. Quality is good right now as Shia … Vashon Island tries to get its rep back. Red Anya Best thing about the Steampunk line is the number of gadgets and doodads you can hide in the accessories. Slave them all to a primo link, drop it into silent mode, and you’ve got a sweet and secure setup that everyone thinks is just high-end fashion. Glitch The Synergist Business line is still the first suit every upand-coming corporate angler makes their life-changing deal in. Most of whom feel they have a little street cred thanks to the pistol they keep tucked snug in the hidden holster built into the clothing. Fianchetto Shiawase brought back the Sleeping Tiger line, but word on the street is they put a hell of a lot more nuyen into R&D than they will ever earn back from the armor. The new incarnation builds from the foundation created by the old with an upgraded color-change system and even an adaptive camouflage feature for the right price. I can guarantee that they’re exploring other uses for this technology. Ma’fan |

(A FULLY LICENSED SUBSIDIARY OF SHIAWASE FASHION)

Can’t resist throwing on the little tag line just so we remember who’s in charge of this line. A few years back these lines were hot, but they’ve been adding feature after feature since then so that the things are getting pretty unwieldy. The rather unoriginal Aces High line added the Ace of Cups (high-collar floor-length coat with back shoulder flaring and flowing-but-layered lower half), Ace of Swords (WWII Japanese pilot style, complete with wakizashi scabbard built into the back), Ace of Wands (new-age wizard styling with lots of little pockets for reagents), and Ace of Coins (black juggernaut hide with platinum thread stitching and solid gold accents) this year and have been having quite a resurgence of both the new and old lines. And before you say anything, yes, I know there are no aces in tarot decks. Vashon Island doesn’t care.

Vashon is still pushing the Steampunk line, as well as the old stand-by Synergist Business tag, along with the dime- (well, maybe a little more) a-dozen Actioneer line of suits. With the Shiawase connection, they have brought back the Sleeping Tiger with a vengeance. Each line has its own set of highlights that can draw a different audience.

All of a sudden the girlfriend on the right is naked. Poof, bikini is gone. The distraction was enough for the other girlfriend to kick up a footfull of sand in my face. The brawl started after that, and I was not happy to discover that both of her “girlfriends” were wearing Second Skin. Kane Never seen boobies before, Kane-o? Slamm-0!

| This is a sexy, sick, twisted version of body armor. Each piece of the Second Skin line is custom tailored for the user, which means that a shift in weight of as little as one or two kilos will make the armor lose its most amazing benefit. That benefit is the fact that it is, for all intents and purposes, invisible. The full body unitard is almost undetectable and includes a completely integrated ruthenium olymer system, which allows the wearer to change any or all aspects of the suit’s appearance. |

| While armored clothing is effective enough, and armored vests are fairly well hidden, it takes truly advanced craftsmanship to produce form-fitting body armor. Each suit is tailor-made to its wearer, leaving neither gaps nor folds while still allowing the body to breathe. The basic piece of armor is a shirt, covering the body from collarbone to groin, protecting the vital organs, while the full suit adds protection for the limbs. In either case, the hands, feet, and head are left exposed, as covering them gives away the fact that armor is being worn. Form-fitting body armor can be worn under armor, but doing so won’t change your protection much. The primary benefit of FFBA is its highly concealable. |

## Hardened Mil-Spec Battle Armor (Light, Medium, Heavy)

| Now we’re talking. Underwear and bracelets are cute and all, but this is the real deal. Stone Great if you’re fighting in Europe in winter but unbearable in hot weather. Marcos No thank you. If you’re in a firefight, something’s gone wrong. Stay light, stick to the shadows, move quickly. Ma’fan And this stuff is impractical for us anyway. Shit, you might as well walk around in a black-and-white striped shirt carrying bags marked with dollar signs, because wearing this in public advertises the fact that you expect someone to shoot at you. Cayman You can always try to use it as a disguise, but it’s an expensive disguise, and you better have the electronic clearances to go with it—if you don’t have some solid identification, don’t expect security systems to give you a pass just because you’re wearing serious armor. DangerSensei For everyone here (but Kane, I suppose) the rule is simple: When the opposition shows up in this, run. Bull Bull’s on point. It’ll save your ass, but it’ll slow your ass down, too. Pursuit isn’t an option. Hard Exit If you do choose to engage, here’s a hint from your Uncle Kane; hard to run in, impossible to swim in. Heh. Kane |

Cutting-edge military hardware, military-grade armor continues to advance in a life-and-death race with weapons and ammunition. Beyond even security-grade armor, military-grade armor is simply too expensive and maintenance-heavy for common use or even routine security work. Aside from the most intense of fast-response teams, it resides only in elite military units deployed when absolutely necessary. Each suit protects from head to toe, custom-fit to the wearer for maximum ergonomic freedom and comfort, an expense that keeps it from the ordinary field grunt. Suits come in a wide variety of exterior design and color, but most modern suits opt for modern electro-chromatic covering for best camo; notable exceptions to this are the silver-plate armors worn by the High Prince of Tír Tairngire’s royal guard and the brilliant crimson of Renraku’s Red Samurai. In each case, the ancient aesthetic is mere decoration; never forget that the armor beneath it is a fully modern design.

Not as heavily armored, or accessory friendly, as their mil-spec big brothers, these are the toughest suits you’ll usually see at a standard corp site. That’s also the only place you’ll probably see them. The armor is designed for protection, not mobility, and walking around in this for much more than a standard patrol puts a strain on most folks.

| | This is actually some of my favorite armor. Blends in a lot of places that other stuff wouldn’t and costs a ton less. 2XL It also protects you a ton less. This stuff is for show when you fall off your bike, not for protecting you in a firefight. Kia Too many trids, not enough real world experience there, Kia. The combat biker teams and outriders in Urban Brawl don’t wear this to look pretty. Get out in the field and see what’s real, not what the trid tells you. 2XL |
| I’ll just call this for what it is, go-gang chic. This stuff comes in a variety of customizable colors with and without cycle brand logos or combat biker team slogans. It’s some of the most obvious armor out there but it seems perfectly normal to anyone who may have seen or heard you arrive on your bike. So people will notice that you’re wearing it, but it won’t automatically make them suspect you’re up to something. |

It’s not just about running into active fires—you can use this anywhere firefighters can go, once the alarm has been pulled. Combine it with the right credentials and you’re one false alarm away from access to almost anywhere. Thorn |
| I carry this, but honestly I can’t think of more than a handful of times where this was purchased for illicit purposes. Firefighters wear it when they run into burning buildings, which is not a place where you normally would find a shadowrunner. |

| Built for intimidation as much as protection, this stuff has a lot of useless fluff surrounding the ballistic plating. Good for blending into a mob or inciting a riot, but not much else in the world of shadowrunning. |

Pockets, holsters, and various clasps keep everything the highly trained officer needs close at hand and easy to access. The electronics suite in these suits is also ideally suited for monitored small-team operations. This stuff is, like most of its relatives in the tactical gear category, not often seen in public places, except those experiencing a hostage situation or other event that calls the badasses in this armor out of their heavily armored truck and straight into your hoop. |

## Securetech PPP

| These pieces are great for a little added protection that can be pulled from a duffel or even a backpack. Runners can avoid drawing attention to their excess of armor, then when trouble comes, pull a few added pieces from the bag and get into the scrape. Frosty I prefer keeping a few kits tucked into a vent before the real action starts. I’ve actually left more of these things behind than used. I consider it a point of my success to know there are 64 sets of this tucked into bathroom and storage closet vents around the world. Ma’fan |

Not a suit in itself, this innovative little AAS, or Armor Augmentation System, is hot for those who like to be able to add a little extra protection to almost anything. Arm, Leg, and Vitals kits are each sold separately, and they augment the protective measures already in place on those areas. The pieces are designed to be taken on and off quickly and worn over existing clothing.

Sticks My biggest issue with this piece is how embarrassing you look when you throw it on. Deranged squatters in the Barrens look better than people wearing this shapeless mess. /dev/grrl Luckily it’s intended to save your hide, not get you best dressed at the corp ball. Sticks |
| I sell this little multipurpose wonder, but honestly I’m not sure why. I guess you can fill it with your favorite guns, get on site, dump it out, and then wear it to protect you. It’s a strange piece, but I sell a lot of them, so you guys have apparently figured out some uses for them. |

So, gangs. Some of those ganger leathers are actually this stuff. There’s added protection, and while it’s cheaper than some forms of armor it’s a hell of a lot more expensive than a simple leather jacket. Spending that money tells your members and other people who know your gang that you’re on the rise. 2XL |

Wireless Bonus Setting off the Flashpak is a Simple Action. | Not exactly a necessity, but it’s good to be aware of these pieces when you’re looking at the sec-team stomping in to break up your latest frag up. Just keep an eye out for the ocular device, usually located in the middle of the shield, that sets off the flashing. Identifying it is the first step to stopping it or avoiding it. DangerSensei Every time I stop in to see Sparks, a ganger pal of mine with the Tesla Armageddon, I get a chuckle at these things leaned all over the place. And gang scuffles are quite the sight as those guys turn it into a strobe rave and zap everything in sight. 2XL |
| I was excited when I saw the Ares FlaShield hit the market. It’s a standard riot shield with the added bonus of a flashpak built onto the front. Defense and offense in one intimidating package! |

| Features Biomonitor, Custom Fit, Holster Special Rules Characters shot while wearing Murder Armor may use an Interrupt Action (–5 Initiative Score) to play dead with an opposed Charisma + Performance [Social] vs. Intuition + Perception [Mental] Test. Use of this armor imposes a –4 dice pool penalty on the observer. Success means the observer ignores the character assuming they are down, and so they get no Defense Test against the character’s next attack. Gorepak replacement requires a Logic + Armorer [Mental] (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. | The twisted mind behind this stuff is a genius. Now mind you, it doesn’t work against real pros who put a bullet through the brainpan to make sure no one is left to come after them. It is great against gangers though, and even average corpsec officers who see a lot of blood and automatically think that means a kill. Thorn |

| This is true specialty armor, designed to protect and deceive. It’s got the latest and greatest in Hollywood practical special effects (yeah, some people still do those) built in so that every decent shot that hits you is made to look like a killshot. This stuff takes some serious grit and a decent bit of acting skill if you really want to fool anyone, but offers a unique chance to turn the tables on an enemy. The mess cleans up easily with warm water, and the gorepak can be replaced fairly easily. |

| Simple and rarely stylish, forearm guards are dermaplast (or, rarely, metallic) bracers fitted to a wearer. Their use is simple—use them to block melee attacks, especially blades, turning blows away without actually cutting into you. |

Ballistic masks can take vision enhancements as well as any modification a helmet can take. Custom jobs are, naturally, more expensive. |

While offering no inherent armor bonus, cloaks are capable of accepting armor modifications: 100¥ per point of Rating (maximum 6). Wearers suffer a -1 Social Limit modifer when wearing a cloak. Designer cloaks can be purchased which match popular high fashion outfits for an additional 300¥, an absolute must if you want to avoid a fashion faux pas (they remove the Social Limit penalty). Cloaks provide a 2 Concealability modifier to items completely hidden underneath. |

## Ruthenium Polymer Cloak

| | |
| A hooded cloak infused with ruthenium polymer fibers. Originally developed for military snipers and spotters who needed to remain concealed and stationary for an extended period of time. The sensor suite that replicates the surroundings has difficulty adapting to the rippling of the cloak while the wearer is in motion. Because of this, the cloak is not as effective while moving as RP modified armor, but it is still fully effective standing still. These cloaks are also sometimes used to conceal small, strategically important objects. The base modifier to a Perception Test to spot the wearer is -(Rating + 2) while stationary and -(Rating - 1) while moving. Maximum rating 4. (That is right, a Rating 1 RP cloak offers no benefit while moving. You just look like you are wearing a poncho made of static. Which may be fashionable in some places, as there is no accounting for Sixth World taste.) An RP cloak has no capacity for any additional armor modifications. |
