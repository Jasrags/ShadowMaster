## Acid

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall

Acid IC targets and overwrites your protective software. When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces your Firewall by 1. If your Firewall has been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

## Binder

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Data Processing

Binder IC corrupts your base operating system. When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces your Data Processing by 1. If your Data Processing has been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

## Black IC

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

Black IC is the most feared intrusion countermeasures program on the market. The hosts that run it don't want you repelled—they want you dead. When it hits, Black IC link-locks you. It also causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage (+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark on the target) along with an equal amount of biofeedback damage.

## Blaster

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Logic + Firewall

Also known as Grey IC, a Blaster IC program's attack causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage, +1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark on the target, with biofeedback damage. The biofeedback from a Blaster program can
only cause Stun damage. A single successful attack also link-locks the target.

## Crash

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

If Crash IC has a mark on you (through its host) and hits, one of your programs crashes, selected at random. Programs crashed this way can't be run again until after a reboot.

## Jammer

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Attack

Jammer IC turns your firewall against your own attacks. When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces your Attack by 1. If your Attack has been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

## Killer

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

This IC is a simple but effective cybercombat program that causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage (+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark) on the target with each successful attack.

## Marker

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Sleaze

Marker IC installs tiny worm programs that mess with your datastreams. When it gets 1 or more net hits on its attack, it reduces your Sleaze by 1. If your Sleaze has been reduced to 0 already, it causes 1 DV Matrix damage per net hit on the attack. The reduction is cumulative and lasts until you reboot the targeted device.

## Patrol

Attack: n/a

Patrol IC acts more like an agent than other intrusion countermeasures. Its job is to patrol a host, scanning people's marks and looking for illegal activity using the Matrix Perception action on all targets in the host. While the act of placing a mark is an illegal activity, the act of simply having a mark is not. Once you have the mark, you are considered a legitimate user. Patrol IC has no attack, but it shares its information with its parent host. Since the Patrol IC doesn’t use Attack actions, it doesn't take Matrix damage when it fails. Most hosts have Patrol IC and keep it running all the time.

## Probe

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

The task of Probe IC is to mark intruders for other IC. Every successful "attack" means another mark for the host and its IC on the target, up to the maximum of three marks.

## Scramble

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Firewall

Scramble IC nukes your connection to the Matrix and forces you to reboot. If the host has three marks on you when this IC hits you, you reboot immediately, taking dumpshock if you were in VR.

## Sparky

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

Sparky IC is also known as "Psycho Killer", an upgraded version of the popular Killer IC. It causes (Attack) DV Matrix damage (+1 DV per net hit and +2 DV per mark on the target) with biofeedback damage.

## Tar Baby

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Logic + Firewall

The Tar Baby IC link-locks you when it hits. If you're already link-locked, it puts a mark on you, up to a maximum of three marks.

## Track

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Sleaze

Track IC follows the datastreams between your icon and your deck. If this IC hits and the host has two marks or more on you, the host (and its owners) discover your physical location, which is usually reported to real-world authorities immediately.

## Bloodhound

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Willpower + Sleaze

This is a hybrid of Patrol and Track IC. It travels a host, looking for illegal activity; when it finds it, it immediately attempts to track the target by getting two or more marks on it to learn its physical location. This has the advantage of having no lag between discovery of a problem and addressing it, but it means the patrolling action stops once the Bloodhound attempts to Track, leaving
possible holes in a patrol design.

## Catapult

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall or Logic + Firewall (defender's choice)

This IC combines some of the effects of Acid and Blaster IC, doing damage to the target’s Firewall while also sending some damage through to the user. If the attack generates any net hits, it temporarily reduces the target's Firewall rating by 1, while also dealing (net hits) Stun damage to the target. The damage is increased by 1 for each mark on the target. The Firewall damage is repaired when the target reboots. Unlike Blaster, successful attacks from Catapult do not link-lock the target.

## Shocker

Attack: Host Rating x 2 [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall

Generally used in tandem with other forms of IC, the goal of Shocker is to slow down the opposition. If its attack hits, instead of doing Matrix damage, it reduces the target's Initiative Score by 5.
