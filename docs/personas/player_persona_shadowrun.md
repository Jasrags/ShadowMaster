Perfect — that gives me a clear foundation.

Since your players will use the same system for **character management, gameplay automation, and session participation**, this persona should reflect a **power user** who thrives on tactical and mechanical mastery, while also valuing narrative impact and group cohesion.

Here’s the **Player Persona** designed to complement your GM persona:

---

# 🎭 Persona: **Riley "Ghostwire" Chen**

**Role:** Veteran Shadowrun Player
**Primary Goal:** Immerse in the world, optimize their character, and experience seamless, automated gameplay that preserves Shadowrun’s tactical depth without bogging down play.

---

## **Profile Overview**

* **Age:** 25–40
* **Occupation:** IT specialist / systems analyst — analytical thinker, detail-oriented, loves optimization.
* **Experience:** 8+ years of Shadowrun across editions; prefers 5e for balance of crunch and flexibility.
* **Playstyle:** Tactical and character-driven. Enjoys building well-optimized characters that feel alive in the world.
* **Tech Skill:** Highly comfortable with digital tools and automation. Often uses digital sheets, macros, or custom spreadsheets to track gear and edge.

---

## **Motivations**

* Wants to **focus on decision-making**, not dice mechanics.
* Appreciates **accurate automation** of Shadowrun’s complex math (recoil, damage, drain, limits).
* Desires **clear feedback** on outcomes — wants to *see* how the system reached a result.
* Enjoys **persistent character progression** — tracking karma, nuyen, street cred, and consequences.
* Seeks **immersion and consistency**: wants the world’s logic and rules to remain coherent session-to-session.
* Values **party coordination** — likes when shared tools (combat tracker, initiative order, matrix actions) keep everyone synchronized.

---

## **Pain Points**

* Manual dice pools and modifiers slow everything down.
* Digital character sheets often desync from campaign state or GM data.
* Gear/cyberware/spell management is fragmented across PDFs and spreadsheets.
* Too many toggles or unclear UI ruins immersion.
* Doesn’t trust “black box” automation that doesn’t explain the result.
* Frustrated when GMs must pause for calculations or rule clarifications mid-combat.

## **Goals**

| **Preparation Goals**                                                        | **In-Session Goals**                                                             | **Post-Session Goals**                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build and customize character (attributes, skills, gear, cyberware, spells). | Focus on narrative and decision-making while system handles rolls and modifiers. | Review session summary — karma, nuyen, and changes to reputation or conditions. |
| Review campaign world and personal hooks.                                    | Quickly declare actions and see immediate, transparent outcomes.                 | Update character sheet and personal notes automatically.                        |
| Ensure equipment and augmentations are synced with GM’s campaign data.       | Track Edge, conditions, and damage without manual math.                          | Analyze character progress or plan upgrades between sessions.                   |

## **Behaviors**

* Likes to min-max — but stays in character; enjoys the optimization challenge.
* Frequently references rulebooks, forums, or PDFs for builds.
* Uses integrated digital sheets or tools (Hero Lab, Chummer, Foundry modules) but finds them clunky or incomplete.
* Keeps notes digitally — logs runs, karma expenditures, and contacts.
* Prefers visual dashboards for combat flow, spell effects, and initiative.
* Uses voice or text chat alongside the app to coordinate with teammates.

# 🧭 Workflow: “Playing in a Shadowrun Campaign”

This describes how Riley would use your web app throughout the campaign lifecycle — from character creation to live sessions.

---

## **1. Character Creation & Setup**

* **Create Character** via guided builder for 5e (Attributes, Skills, Qualities, Gear, Cyberware, Magic).
* **Automation assists** with validation (e.g., build point caps, resource limits).
* **Preview derived stats**: initiative, physical/mental limits, damage tracks, matrix attributes.
* Save to **personal roster**; can join campaign when invited by a GM.
* **Sync** with campaign settings (house rules, availability of gear/magic, starting resources).

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “I want to build my runner without constantly flipping through PDFs. Let me see exactly how each choice affects my stats.”

---

## **2. Joining a Campaign**

* Accept **GM invitation** → campaign dashboard opens with:

  * Session schedule and summaries.
  * Known NPCs, factions, and past runs.
  * Shared notes or world intel.
* Character is linked to GM’s campaign data, ensuring consistency (gear prices, house rules).

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “Everything about this run — the crew, the factions, the paydata — should be in one place.”

---

## **3. Session Preparation**

* Review previous session’s log, outstanding objectives, and character condition (damage, ammo, spells).
* Update gear loadout or spell prep.
* Optionally roll downtime or legwork actions (automated).

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “Before the session, I want to make sure my character is ready — gear loaded, spells known, and no missing data.”

---

## **4. Live Session Mode**

* Session dashboard opens with:

  * Scene summary and current objectives.
  * Character action interface (Attack, Cast, Hack, Sneak, etc.).
  * Automated roll results with transparent breakdowns (dice pool, modifiers, hits, limits).
* Combat automation includes:

  * Initiative tracking.
  * Edge usage and modifiers.
  * Automatic damage calculation and status tracking.
* Matrix or Astral actions use parallel interfaces, integrated with GM view.

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “I should feel like I’m acting through my character — every roll, spell, and bullet should just *work* while I focus on tactics and story.”

---

## **5. Post-Session Wrap-Up**

* Automatic summary:

  * Karma and nuyen earned.
  * Items or contacts gained.
  * Notable story outcomes.
* Updates to character sheet are applied automatically.
* Option to leave notes, plan purchases, or track goals.

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “I want to log off knowing my character is up to date and ready for next time — no paperwork, no recalculations.”

---

## **6. Between Sessions**

* Access **character sheet anytime** to review stats, spend karma, or plan upgrades.
* Review campaign timeline or mission logs.
* Participate in **asynchronous legwork** (research, hacking, contacting NPCs) through side actions or downtime modules.

> 💡 *Player Perspective:* “Let me stay connected to the world even between runs — downtime should still feel meaningful.”

Would you like me to create this as a **Markdown file for download** (like the GM persona), or would you prefer I combine **both personas into a single document** with consistent structure and formatting (e.g., “GM Persona” and “Player Persona” sections)?
