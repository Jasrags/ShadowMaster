The Point Buy method has greater flexibility than any
other system; the tradeoff, of course, is that the com-
plete range of options available can make character
creation a somewhat time-consuming process. For
many, though, the time investment is worth it, as they
have the chance to design a character precisely the
way they want it to be.
In the Point Buy system, you start with 800 Karma.
The first thing you have to do is purchase a metatype, as
per the Metatype Cost Table.
Once you have purchased your metatype, set your
attributes at the minimum levels using the Metatype At-
tribute Table on p. 66, SR5, or p. 106 of this book. From
this point on, the Point Buy system generally works simi-
lar to Character Advancement (p 103, SR5), only you are
advancing a character with the minimum attributes for
their metatype and no skills. The player uses Karma to
buy attributes, skills, qualities, contacts (per the rules on
p. 98, SR5), gear (at the cost of 1 Karma for every 2,000
nuyen; a maximum of 200 Karma can be spent this way),
and anything else needed to flesh the character out. The
things that must be taken in consideration are the fol-
lowing: First, as with the Priority System, characters at
creation may only have 1 Mental or Physical attribute
at their natural maximum (the special attributes—Edge,
Magic, and Resonance—do not fall under this limit). Sec-
ond, if characters want to use Magic or the Resonance,
they must buy one of the additional qualities below:
Adept (20 Karma): This makes a character an adept,
able to channel mana into physical abilities. They get a
Magic Rating of 1 and can buy more ranks with Karma.
As with customary character creation, the character gets
free power points equal to their Magic Rating. For more
information on adepts, see p. 69, SR5.
Aspected Magician (15 Karma): Selecting this quality
allows a character to be an aspected magician, meaning
they are skilled in one particular area of magic—Sorcery,
Conjuring, or Enchanting. They get a Magic Rating of 1
and can buy more ranks with Karma. For more informa-
tion on the abilities and limitations of aspected magi-
cians, see p. 69, SR5.
Magician (30 Karma): This makes the character a mag-
ic-user, able to cast spells, conjure spirits, and use other
magical abilities. They get a Magic Rating of 1 and can buy
more ranks with Karma. For more information on magi-
cians and what they can do, see p. 69, SR5.
Mystic Adept (35 Karma): This makes the character
a mystic adept, a hybrid of magician and adept who can
cast spells while also gaining some of the physical abil-

ities of an adept. They get a Magic Rating of 1 and can
buy more ranks with Karma. They do not gain free pow-
er points; instead, they need to buy power points at a
cost of 5 Karma per power point (to a maximum number
equal to their Magic Rating).
Technomancer (15 Karma): With this quality, a char-
acter becomes a technomancer. They gain the Reso-
nance attribute at a level of 1 and can buy more ranks
with Karma. For more information on technomancers,
see the Life as a Technomancer in 2075 sidebar on p.
69, SR5, as well as game rules starting on p. 249, SR5.
Note that leftover Karma from the point-buy process
cannot be carried over from character creation—it’s use it
or lose it! As with the priority system, no more than 5,000
nuyen can be carried over from character creation. Char-
acters roll for starting nuyen per their purchased lifestyle,
using the Starting Nuyen Table, p. 95, SR5.
