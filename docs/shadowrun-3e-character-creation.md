# Shadowrun 3rd Edition Character Creation Guide

## Overview

Shadowrun 3rd Edition uses a **Priority System** for character creation. Players assign priorities (A through E, where A is highest) to five categories: Magic, Race, Attributes, Skills, and Resources. Each priority level provides different benefits in that category.

## Master Character Creation Table

This is the core reference table for Shadowrun 3rd Edition character creation.

| Priority | Race      | Magic                   | Attributes | Skills | Resources  |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------|------------|--------|------------|
| A        | All       | Full Magician           | 30         | 50     | 1,000,000¥ |
| B        | All       | Adept/Aspected Magician | 27         | 40     | 400,000¥   |
| C        | Troll/Elf | N/A                     | 24         | 34     | 90,000¥    |
| D        | Dwarf/Ork | N/A                     | 21         | 30     | 20,000¥    |
| E        | Human     | N/A                     | 18         | 27     | 5,000¥     |

## Priority System

### General Rules
- Each priority (A-E) can only be assigned **once**
- Priority A = highest/best, Priority E = lowest/least
- Magic priority can be "N/A" (for non-magical characters) at Priority C, D, or E
- When assigning priorities, you select one row from the table above

### How It Works

**Example Priority Selection:**
- If you choose **Attributes Priority A**: You get 30 attribute points
- If you choose **Attributes Priority B**: You get 27 attribute points
- If you choose **Attributes Priority C**: You get 24 attribute points
- If you choose **Attributes Priority D**: You get 21 attribute points
- If you choose **Attributes Priority E**: You get 18 attribute points

**The same applies to Race, Magic, Skills, and Resources.**

### Priority Categories

#### 1. Race Priority
Determines which metatype (race) the character can be.

| Priority | Metatypes Available |
|----------|---------------------|
| A | All (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Ork, Troll) |
| B | All (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Ork, Troll) |
| C | Troll or Elf only |
| D | Dwarf or Ork only |
| E | Human only |

**Racial Modifications Table:**

| Race | Modifications |
|------|---------------|
| Human | No attribute modifiers (baseline) |
| Dwarf | +1 Body, +2 Strength, +1 Willpower<br>Thermographic Vision<br>Resistance (+2 Body to any disease or toxin) |
| Elf | +1 Quickness, +2 Charisma<br>Low-light Vision |
| Ork | +3 Body, +2 Strength, -1 Charisma, -1 Intelligence |
| Troll | +5 Body, -1 Quickness, +4 Strength, -2 Intelligence, -2 Charisma<br>Thermographic Vision<br>+1 Reach for Armed/Unarmed Combat<br>Dermal Armor (+1 Body) |

**Important Notes:**
- Attribute modifiers are applied **after** attribute point distribution
- No character may start with any attribute higher than **6** (before racial modifiers)
- After racial modifiers are applied, attributes may exceed 6 (subject to metatype maximums)
- Physical or Mental attributes cannot be less than 1 (after modifiers)
- Special abilities (vision, resistance, reach, armor) are in addition to attribute modifiers

#### 2. Magic Priority

- Points can be allocated unevenly (e.g., 8 points to Body, 4 to Quickness, etc.)
- **Minimum per attribute:** 1 point (Physical or Mental attributes cannot be less than 1)
- **Maximum per attribute:** 6 points before racial modifiers
- After racial modifiers applied, attributes may exceed 6 (subject to metatype maximums)

#### 4. Skills Priority
Determines total skill points available.

| Priority | Skill Points | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|

**Skill Rules:**
- Skill points can be used for Active Skills, Knowledge Skills, and Language Skills
- **Skill Cost Calculation:**
  - Each skill has a **linked attribute** (e.g., Pistols links to Quickness, Computer links to Intelligence)
  - **If skill rating ≤ linked attribute rating:** Cost is **1 skill point per skill rating**
    - Example: Quickness 4, Pistols Rating 3 → Cost = 3 points (3 × 1)
  - **If skill rating > linked attribute rating:** Cost is **2 skill points per skill rating**
    - Example: Quickness 4, Pistols Rating 6 → Cost = 12 points (6 × 2)
- **Specializations:** Cost additional points (typically +1 point)
- **Skill Groups:** May have different costs (consult skill group rules)
- **Maximum starting skill rating:** Typically 6 (subject to linked attribute constraints)

#### 5. Resources Priority
Determines starting nuyen (money).

| Priority | Starting Nuyen | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| A | 1,000,000¥ | Very wealthy start |
| B | 400,000¥ | Wealthy start |
| C | 90,000¥ | Moderate wealth |
| D | 20,000¥ | Limited funds |
| E | 5,000¥ | Poor start |

## Character Creation Order

**Note:** Priorities (A-E) should be assigned to Magic, Race, Attributes, Skills, and Resources before beginning character creation. Each priority is used only once.

### Step 1: Choose Race (Metatype)
1. Based on Race priority, choose metatype:
   - Priority A or B: All races available (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Ork, Troll)
   - Priority C: Troll or Elf only
   - Priority D: Dwarf or Ork only
   - Priority E: Human only
2. Apply metatype attribute modifiers
3. Note attribute maximums for chosen metatype

### Step 2: Choose Magical Abilities
1. Based on Magic priority, choose magical type:
   - **Priority A**: Full Magician (Mage/Shaman)
   - **Priority B**: Adept or Aspected Magician (Mage/Shaman)
   - **Priority C, D, E**: Mundane (no magical ability)
2. If Full Magician or Aspected Magician:
   - Select Tradition: Shamanic or Hermetic
   - If Shamanic we need to choose a totem.  
   - Note spell points received (Full Magician: 25, Aspected: 35)
   - Note Magic Rating (Full Magician: 6, Aspected/Adept: 4)
3. If Adept:
   - Note Power Points received (25)
   - Note Magic Rating (4)
4. If Mundane:
   - Magic Rating = 0

### Step 3: Choose Attributes (Distribute Attribute Points)
1. Based on Attributes priority, receive attribute points (30, 27, 24, 21, or 18)
2. Distribute points among **six** of the **nine** attributes:
   - **Allocated attributes:** Body, Quickness, Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, Charisma
   - **Derived attributes:** Essence, Magic, Reaction (determined separately)
3. Each allocated attribute must have at least 1 point
4. No allocated attribute can have more than 6 points (before modifiers)
5. Apply metatype racial modifiers
6. Verify attributes don't exceed metatype maximums
7. Calculate Reaction: (Quickness + Intelligence) ÷ 2, rounded down
8. Set Essence to 6.0 (will decrease with cyberware)
9. Set Magic Rating based on Magic priority (0-6)

### Step 4: Assigning Skills
Based on Skills priority, receive skill points (50, 40, 34, 30, or 27).

1. **Purchase Active Skills**
   - Physical and magical actions (Pistols, Spellcasting, Stealth, etc.)
   - **Skill Point Cost Calculation:**
     - Determine the skill's linked attribute (e.g., Pistols → Quickness, Computer → Intelligence)
     - Compare skill rating to linked attribute rating:
       - **If skill rating ≤ linked attribute:** Cost = 1 point per rating
         - Example: Quickness 5, Pistols Rating 4 → Cost = 4 points
       - **If skill rating > linked attribute:** Cost = 2 points per rating
         - Example: Quickness 3, Pistols Rating 5 → Cost = 10 points (5 × 2)
   - **Note:** Skill costs vary based on attributes, so attribute distribution affects skill point efficiency

2. **Add Specializations**
   - Specializations cost +1 additional point per specialization
   - Can be added to active skills

3. **Purchase Knowledge Skills**
   - Academic, Street, Professional, Technical knowledge
   - Same cost calculation rules as active skills (based on linked attribute, typically Intelligence or Charisma)

4. **Purchase Language Skills**
   - Language skills represent the ability to understand and speak spoken and written language
   - **Free Native Language:** Characters receive one language at rating 6 for free (typically English)
   - **Language Skill Points:** Available language skill points = Intelligence × 1.5 (rounded down)
   - **Separate from Regular Skill Points:** Language skill points are separate from active/knowledge skill points
   - **Cost Calculation:** Same as other skills (1 point per rating if ≤ Intelligence, 2 points per rating if > Intelligence)
   - **Linked Attribute:** All language skills link to Intelligence
   - **Understanding Complexity:** When reading/listening, language skill rating determines what can be understood:
     - Rating 2: Universal concepts (hunger, fear, bodily functions)
     - Rating 4: Basic conversation (concerns of daily life)
     - Rating 6: Complex subjects (special/limited-interest topics)
     - Rating 9: Intricate subjects (almost any technical subject)
     - Rating 11: Obscure subjects (deeply technical/rare knowledge)
     - Speaking lingo/variation: +2 to target number

5. Record skill ratings and track remaining skill points

### Step 5: Assigning Resources
Based on Resources priority, receive starting nuyen (1,000,000¥, 400,000¥, 90,000¥, 20,000¥, or 5,000¥).

Resources are spent in the following order:

1. **Magical Gear and Spells** (if applicable)
   - **For Full Magicians (Priority A):**
     - Spend spell points: 1 point per spell Force
     - Can bond foci: 1 spell point per Force rating (instead of nuyen)
     - Can purchase additional spell points: 25,000¥ per point (max 50 total spell points)
     - Can begin with conjured spirits: 1 spell point per Force + 2 spell points per service
     - Limitations:
       - No spells, foci, or spirits higher than Force 6
       - Cannot begin with more than 6 spirits
       - Cannot begin with any spirit owning more than 6 services
   - **For Aspected Magicians (Priority B):**
     - Spend spell points: 1 point per spell Force
     - Can purchase additional spell points: 25,000¥ per point (max 50 total spell points)
   - **For Adepts (Priority B):**
     - Receive 25 Power Points at creation
     - Spend Power Points on adept powers (not nuyen)
     - **Power Types:**
       - **Fixed Cost Powers:** Pay listed Power Point cost (e.g., Astral Perception: 2 Power Points)
       - **Per-Level Powers:** Pay cost × level (e.g., Attribute Boost: 0.25 per level)
     - **Available Powers:**
       - Astral Perception (2 Power Points) - Can perceive the astral plane
       - Attribute Boost (0.25 Power Points per level) - Boosts an attribute (must specify which attribute)
     - More adept powers can be added as they are provided
   - Purchase magical gear (foci, ritual materials, etc.) with nuyen

2. **Cyberware**
   - Purchase cyberware with nuyen
   - Each cyberware item has:
     - Cost (in nuyen)
     - Essence cost (reduces Essence from starting 6.0)
     - Availability rating (may need dice rolls to acquire)
   - When installing cyberware:
     - Deduct nuyen cost
     - Subtract Essence cost from current Essence
     - **Cannot go below 0.1 Essence** (essence of 0 = death)
   - Bioware costs nuyen but doesn't reduce Essence (much more expensive)

3. **Contacts**
   - **Free Contacts:** Characters begin with two free level 1 contacts
   - **Contact Levels:**
     - Level 1 (Contact): 5,000¥
     - Level 2 (Buddy): 10,000¥
     - Level 3 (Friend for life): 200,000¥
   - **Loyalty Rating:** 1-3 (not 1-6)
   - **Contact Types:** Fixer, Dealer, Street Doc, Bartender, Information Broker, Corporate, Gang, Law Enforcement, Media, Smuggler, Talislegger, General
   - **No Limits:** No limits on starting contacts
   - Each contact has:
     - Name
     - Type (contact type)
     - Level (1-3)
     - Loyalty rating (1-3)

4. **Lifestyle**
   - Choose starting lifestyle (monthly cost):
     - Street: 0¥
     - Squatter: 100¥
     - Low: 1,000¥
     - Middle: 5,000¥
     - High: 10,000¥
     - Luxury: 100,000¥
   - Lifestyle is a monthly recurring cost
   - Lifestyle affects monthly expenses and quality of life

5. **Other Equipment**
   - Purchase weapons, armor, bioware, gear, vehicles
   - Each item has:
     - Cost (in nuyen)
     - Availability rating (may need dice rolls to acquire)
     - Essence cost (for cyberware/bioware)
   - Track remaining nuyen

### Step 6: Final Details
1. Calculate final Essence (6.0 minus all cyberware costs)
   - Essence cannot be lowered to 0 or less (essence of 0 = death)
   - Verify Essence is at least 0.1
2. Calculate final Reaction: (Quickness + Intelligence) ÷ 2, rounded down
3. Verify all priorities used correctly (A-E each used once)
4. Verify attribute minimums (no Physical or Mental attribute < 1)
5. Verify attribute maximums respected (no attribute > 6 before modifiers, then check metatype max)
6. Verify skill points spent correctly (consider linked attribute costs)
7. Verify spell points/Power Points spent correctly (if magical)
8. Verify nuyen spent (can't go negative, track remaining nuyen)
9. Set starting values:
   - **Karma**: 0 (starting karma)
   - **Total Karma**: 0 (lifetime karma earned)
   - **Reputation**: All categories start at 0
     - Street Cred: 0
     - Notoriety: 0
     - Public Awareness: 0
   - **Initiation Grade**: 0 (for magical characters)
10. Add character name, background, notes

## Questions & Uncertainties

**📋 For a comprehensive list of unanswered questions and gaps, see [Questions and Gaps Analysis](./questions-and-gaps.md)**

### Critical Gaps (Blocking Implementation):
1. **Skill Linked Attributes** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Skill-to-attribute mapping implemented in codebase
2. **Racial Modifiers** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Official racial modifications table integrated
3. **Racial Special Abilities** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Special abilities tracking implemented (vision, resistance, reach)
4. **Troll Dermal Armor** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Automatically added as inherent cyberware for Trolls
5. **Metatype Attribute Maximums** ⚠️ - Cannot validate attributes without knowing maximum values
6. **Contacts System** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Contact cost structure and types implemented
7. **Lifestyle System** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Lifestyle costs implemented
8. **Spell Lists** ⚠️ - Need list of available spells and tradition restrictions
9. **Adept Powers** ✅ - **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** - Basic structure implemented, initial powers added (Astral Perception, Attribute Boost)
10. **Aspected Magician Restrictions** ⚠️ - Details on what "certain restrictions" and "one aspect" means
11. **Language Skills Details** ✅ - **RESOLVED** - Language skill system implemented with free native language and complexity table

2. **Skills Specializations**: ✅ Confirmed - +1 additional point on top of base skill rating
   
3. **Starting Karma**: Question remains - Is starting karma always 0 or can it vary?
   
4. **Contacts During Creation**: Question remains - Can contacts be purchased with nuyen or only allocated?
   
5. **Bioware vs Cyberware**: Clarification needed - Some sources say no essence cost, others say minimal. Verify exact rules.
   
6. **Availability Restrictions**: Question remains - Should we enforce availability ratings or allow any equipment purchase?

## Implementation Notes

### Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Basic priority system structure
- ✅ Attribute point allocation (simplified - flat values per priority)
- ✅ Skills database with official SR3 skills
- ✅ Equipment databases (weapons, armor, cyberware)
- ⚠️ Attribute distribution needs refinement (currently gives same points to all attributes)
- ⚠️ Metatype selection needs full implementation (currently defaults to Human)
- ⚠️ Magic system not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Skill point spending needs validation (must calculate costs based on linked attributes)
- ⚠️ Skill linked attributes need to be tracked in the skill database
- ⚠️ Equipment purchasing with nuyen tracking needs implementation

### Recommended Implementation Order
1. Fix attribute distribution system (point-based with player choice)
2. Implement full metatype selection with modifiers
3. Add skill point calculation and validation
4. Implement magic system (spells, traditions)
5. Add nuyen tracking and equipment purchasing validation
6. Add availability restrictions (optional)
