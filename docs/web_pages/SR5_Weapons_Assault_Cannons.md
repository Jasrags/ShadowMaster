## Ares Thunderstruck Gauss Rifle

| 7(8) | 15P | -8 | SA | (1) | 10(c) + Energy | 24F | 26,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

Standard upgrades
:   Laser sight, shock pad

Ammo
:   The Thunderstruck uses both ammunition and energy for each round fired. Power is supplied by peak-discharge battery packs and consumes 1 power unit per shot. The Thunderstruck can hold one power clip or draw its energy from an external source such as a satchel power pack, power backpack, or vehicle power if mounted.

Ares has had there fair share of arms troubles over the past few years but this was not one of them. The Thunderstruck has been a massive market success, gaining even more brand recognition than the Panther XXL in the assault cannon category. It doesn’t pack quite the punch of a standard AC, but its lighter recoil load, quicker cycle time, and unmatched armor penetration have gone a long way to sway those consumers concerned about the heavier price tag.

## Ares Vigorous Assault Cannon

The Ares Vigorous was billed as an early competitor for the Panther XXL. Early word of mouth on the early, bare-bones base model was poisonous, and that carried over to the models with all the bells and whistles. The nice part about that is if you don’t care about a smartlink system and realize firing twice with an assault cannon means you’ve done something wrong, then the Vigorous is your cannon of choice.

| 6 (7) | 16P | –6 | SS | – | 4(m) | 20F | 23,000¥ | SR5:GH3 |

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Laser Sight, Powered Slide Mount (Rating 2)

Krime is pleased to announce its first pump-action assault cannon intended for the weaker meta-types to use. The revolutionary recoil suppression system allows lighter body mass personnel to carry the heaviest firepower available. The Bomb also incorporates a powered slide mount and laser sight, allowing the user a multitude of tactical accessories. Carry the Bomb, and be the bomb.

- This is definitely not typical from Krime. They’ve started to get a pretty large following within the Sons of Sauron and other radical meta groups. I wonder why they’re risking involvement with that market segment—there are plenty of ways for that to go wrong.
  - Mihoshi Oni

- Maybe because they’re following the money. While there are a lot of Orks and Trolls roaming around the world they tend to have the lower paying jobs and if they’re working for a corp or government, they get issued whatever they carry anyway.
  - Dr. Spin

- All I can say is the pump-action is a bitch to use when you’re on the move. They might claim it’s for smaller builds, but it still takes effort to chamber a round.
  - Marcos

## Krime Cannon

| 4 | 16P | –6 | SA | (1) | 6(m) | 20F | 21,000¥ | Core |

Modifiers
:   Modified for Trolls by Default

Krime may be a small-time manufacturer, but their assault cannon, simply called the Cannon, is a cheap heavy weapon big on attitude and firepower. It comes standard with modification for trolls, and so is the first weapon in the Sixth World to be intended for larger customers.

## Ogre Hammer SWS Assault Cannon

| Acc | DV | AP | Mode | RC | Ammo | Avail | Cost | Source |

Standard upgrades
:   Advanced safety, integrated commlink (Device Rating 4), imaging scope (night vision, flare compensation, image link, magnification)

“Pounds like no other” is the sales slogan attached to this heavy hitter. The Ogre Hammer puts a whole lot of hurt downrange by improving the weapon’s recoil handling and cycle speed to allow slightly faster firing than other weapons in its class. It’s called man portable, but that’s a bit of a stretch.

Modifiers
:   SmartGun

This huge fragging gun is an assault cannon that uses ammunition similar to the primary weapon in many small tanks. It comes with a built-in smartgun system.
