The Fifth-World legends of Bigfoot were true. Either sasquatches were born before the Awakening or they are just a long-lived race able to hide for millennia. Sasquatches have never revealed the truth and likely never will. These sapient paranormal beings stand three meters tall and possess a muscular build similar to trolls. They are covered in fur that can be black, brown, pale yellow, or auburn; this fur develops silver tips with age. A sasquatch’s native region usually determines their color, coloring the creature to provide the best camouflage based on the environment. Sasquatches are omnivorous but lean toward food that doesn’t run away, though in the Sixth World that doesn’t necessarily disqualify some plants. Though they lack the ability to speak—the concept of a spoken language is foreign and incomprehensible to them—sasquatches have an amazing ability to mimic audio sounds, which they use when hunting.

Sasquatches have been remarkably successful at entering metahuman society when they choose, with work often found in entertainment and politics. Some use audio mimicry ability to create sounds for trids and simflicks; others act as diplomats and ambassadors to other sapient paranormal beings.
