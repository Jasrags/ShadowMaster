**Modifying Weapons**

| Each accessory in this section is classified as an “accessory” or a “modification.” An accessory can be installed with little difficulty by pretty much anyone onto the top, bottom, or side slots. Just buy it, snap it on one of your available mounts, and you’re off and running. Note, though, that these accessories cannot be snapped on and off in a short amount of time (unless you have a slide mount, p. 52). Assume swapping them on and off takes at least five minutes while sitting still, making it impractical to do while in the middle of a firefight. In case it needs to be said, you can’t install the same modification or accessory twice and expect to double the benefits. If you really want to, you can install the same modification in two different spots, but you’ll only get the benefit once, so you’ll be wasting a slot. You also can only have one modification per slot. Some types of weapons have further limitations—for example, light pistols can only take top and barrel-mounted accessories, while hold-outs can’t take accessories at all. If you add an accessory to the stock, barrel, or internal slots, or add a modification, a little more work is needed. Here’s what to do: Make sure you know what to do. Make a [Type of Weapon Knowledge skill] + Logic (4) [Mental] Test to see if you know how to make the necessary modification. If you want a little help on the test, you can search for plans that might provide guidance. This can be a Matrix Search (Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]) with a threshold based on the availability of the modification (see Matrix Search, p. 241, SR5). Restricted mods should have a threshold of at least 3, and forbidden items should have a threshold of at least 6. Players can also ask their contacts for plans; use the basic legwork rules (p. 387, SR5) to discover if the contact knows what to do and is willing to share it with the player’s character. If you are able to find plans, add 6 dice to your test to see if you know how to make the modification. Prepare the proper tools. Unless otherwise noted, a kit is sufficient to attach accessories to the top, underneath, or side slots, while a shop is needed for internal, barrel, or stock modifications. Roll the test. For weapons modifications, this is generally going to be an Armorer + Logic [Mental] Extended Test, with thresholds and intervals determined using the guidelines on p. 48, SR5. |

Most firearm accessories must be attached to a particular mount—top, barrel, underbarrel. Each mount can only hold one accessory at a time.

Got a gun? Great. Is it just like it was when you bought it, the same model any schmuck can buy in their neighborhood Lock ‘n’ Load? Then you’re doing it wrong. You’re not some ordinary, off-the-shelf person, right? You’ve got your own skills and characteristics, the things that make you different from anyone else, the things that give you your edge. Your character’s weapon should reflect that—it should have qualities that accentuate your strong points and mitigate your weaknesses.

Let’s start with the basics of how you’re going to add stuff to your weapon. When you want to add something to your weapon, it’s going to go into one of six places. 1) One top of the weapon; 2) Underneath the barrel of a weapon; 3) On the side of a weapon; 4) Internal to the weapon, meaning it is built into the weapon and integral to its systems; 5) Replacing or adding to the barrel; 6) Replacing or adding to the stock.

Some accessories are easy to add—a snap-on part here, a screw there, and boom, it’s done. Other parts are a little more complicated and should only be put on by someone who knows what they are doing.

Given that you want to do something to modify your weapon—because we just told you that you do—we should talk about what you might do to your weapon. So here are the mods, and what you need to know to get them in place.

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6R | 600¥ | Core |

| Wireless Detonate Grenade/Rocket Remotely |  |
| This grenade/rocket launcher smartgun accessory uses a “smart” rangefinder to air-burst the explosive projectile at a point deemed to be both a safe distance from the launcher and within the closest possible proximity to the target. An airburst link reduces the scatter distance for a launched grenade by two meters per net hit instead of by one meter per hit (Determine Scatter, p. 182) when you use the wireless link trigger. An airburst link requires wireless functionality to function at all. Both the grenades and the launcher must have wireless mode turned on. |

## Bipod

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top or Under | 2 | 125¥ | Core |

| Activate/Deactivate Simple Action Wireless The wireless laser sight provides a +1 dice pool bonus on attack tests, not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. Activating and deactivating the laser sight is a Free Action. |  |
| This device uses a laser beam to project a visible dot (in your choice of colors) on the target. This increases the weapon’s Accuracy by 1, which is not cumulative with smartlink modifiers. The laser sight can be attached to either the underbarrel mount or top mount. Activating or deactivating a laser sight is a Simple Action. |

## Periscope

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 4 | 175¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| This easy access holster can hold any weapon of Machine Pistol or smaller size. It reduces the threshold for quick-drawing the holstered weapon by 1 (see Quick Draw, p. 165). |

## Shock Pad

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 2 | 50¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| A shock-absorbing pad is situated on the rigid stock of a rifle, shotgun, or heavy weapon, and provides 1 point of recoil compensation. |

## Silencer/Suppressor

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barrel | 9F | 500¥ | Core |

| Wireless The silencer/suppressor features a Rating 2 microphone with Rating 2 Select Sound Filter and simple software that alerts you via AR if your silencer detects the sound of someone nearby reacting to the sound of the silenced weapon. |  |
| This barrel-mounted accessory reduces the sound and flash of a weapon’s discharge. It cannot be used with revolvers or shotguns. It applies a –4 dice pool modifier on all Perception Tests to notice the weapon’s use or locate the weapon’s firer. Attaching or removing a silencer takes a Complex Action. |

## Smart Firing Platform

| Under | 12F | 2,500¥ | Core |

| Wireless You can fire the mounted weapon remotely (Control Device, p. 238), like a drone with no rigger interface. You can use an implanted smartlink with the smartgun if you’re in VR. |  |
| This is a non-mobile robotic tripod equipped with a remote control pivot that allows for a 180-degree firing arc and a 60-degree inclination. You can mount one smartgun-equipped weapon to the platform, and it will be fired by the device’s onboard Pilot (Device Rating 3). The platform is equipped with a Targeting Autosoft (Rating 3) and can be upgraded with additional autosofts, usually a Clearsight program. You need to set the parameters of who exactly the platform should and shouldn’t shoot at, which are followed by the platform’s pilot (Pilot Programs, p. 269). The platform provides 5 points of Recoil Compensation. It has an Initiative attribute of Pilot x 2 and 4D6 Initiative Dice when acting autonomously (see Drone Initiative, p. 270). |

## Smartgun System

### Smartgun System, Internal

### Smartgun System, External

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Top or Under | 4R | 200¥ | Core |

| Attach to Gun Armor + Logic (4, 1 Hour) Extended Test Vision Enhancements Capacity 1 Wireless A wireless smartlink provides a dice pool bonus to all attacks with the weapon: +1 if you’re using gear with a smartlink or +2 if you’re using an augmentation for which you paid Essence. Ejecting a clip and changing fire modes are Free Actions. |  |
| This connects a firearm or a projectile weapon directly to the user’s smartlink. Incorporating a small camera and laser range finder, the smartlink keeps track of ammunition, heat buildup, and material stress. If you have a smartlink, you can mentally switch between gun modes, eject a clip, and fire the gun without pulling the trigger. The camera lets you shoot around corners without exposing yourself to return fire (at a –3 dice pool penalty). The system makes use of advanced calculation software, allowing for precisely calculated trajectories and high precision over any distance. If you’re using a smartlink, the smartgun system increases the gun’s Accuracy by 2. The smartgun features are accessed either by universal access port cable to an imaging device (like glasses, goggles, or a datajack for someone with cybereyes) or by a wireless connection working in concert with direct neural interface. Retrofitting a firearm with an internal smartgun system doubles the weapon’s price and adds 2 to its Availability. An external smartgun system can be attached to the top mount or underbarrel mount with an Armorer + Logic (4, 1 hour) Extended Test. The small camera has a capacity of 1 and can be equipped with vision enhancements (p. 444). |

## Spare Clip

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 4 | 5¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| A spare clip comes unloaded but can hold the maximum rounds for the weapon. Each clip is specific to the weapon you buy it for, but they all cost the same. And yes, it’s technically a detachable box magazine, but the Cityspeak word for it is so popular these days that even the catalogs call them clips. |

## Speed Loader

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Fully Reload Revolver Complex Action |  |
| The speed loader is a simple device that holds a ring of bullets for fast insertion into a revolver’s cylinder. Each speed loader is specific to the weapon it was designed for. It lets you fully reload a revolver as a Complex Action instead of having to load rounds one at a time (Reloading Weapons table, p. 163). |

## Tripod

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Under | 4 | 500¥ | Core |

| Attach/ One Minute Fold/Deploy:Free Action Wireless Folding up, deploying, or removing the tripod is a Free Action. |  |
| The tripod provides a stable base to fire a weapon low to the ground with the user kneeling or sitting. A tripod can be attached to the underbarrel mount and provides 6 points of Recoil Compensation when properly deployed. Attaching a tripod takes one minute. Folding up or deploying the bipod is a Free Action. |

## Advanced Safety System

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 4 | 600¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| It’s always good to make sure your weapon only goes off when you want it to. The advance safety system works along with your smartlink (meaning that you need a smartlink to have one of these) to make sure only an authorized user fires the gun. There are a few ways to pull this off—one is to have biometric scanners in the grip or butt of the weapon, or the system can scan for an authorized RFID tag or PAN within 1 meter of the weapon. (This works similarly to a maglock card reader, system, p. 363, SR5.) If the authorized user(s) is present or holding the gun, it’ll be ready to fire. If not, no dice. These systems have a default Device Rating of 3. The basic system keeps unauthorized users from firing the gun, but you can put on a few extras to make things a little more interesting for people trying to mess with your stuff. |

### Advanced Safety System, Immobilization

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6 | 100¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| The immobilizer locks everything up so that it will take more than a biometric scan to get it going again; instead, you need an Armorer took kit and an Armorer + Logic (12, 5 minutes) Extended Test to get it working again. |

### Advanced Safety System, Self Destruct

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Self destruct bricks the thing but good, damaging the internals beyond repair. |

### Advanced Safety System, Explosive Self Destruct

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 11F | 400¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| Explosive self destruct is the next step up, blowing the weapon up with 14P(f) damage (AP –5 for the person holding the weapon, +4 for anyone else) and a –2/m blast radius. |

### Advanced Safety System, Electro Shocker

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6R | 350¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| Electro shocker delivers 5S(e) damage to the miscreant using your weapon; it can go off three times before it needs to be recharged. You can only have one extra deterrent as part of your safety system. The system, whether it’s the basic one or a fancier version, can only go in the internal slot. |

## Bayonet

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| Top or Under | 4R | 50¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| Some people think the bayonet charge became obsolete around the time of the Amer ican Civil War. Some people are not creative enough. A blade on the end of your firearm means more options, and in the shadows, this can be a very good thing to have. Bayonets can be fixed to the top or underneath slots of rifle-sized or larger weapons (though honestly, fixing one on top of your HMG is not going to be terribly useful). When attached on a weapon, it has Reach 2, DV (STR +1)P, and AP –1; it has the same stats when detached, only its Reach is 0. In either case, use the Blades skill when attacking with it. |

## Concealed Quick-Draw Holster

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6 | 275¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| What more do you want a holster to do? You get to reduce the Concealability modifier of your weapon by 1 while the threshold to quick-draw a holstered weapon drops by 1. It won’t fire the thing for you, though, so buckle down and do it yourself. The holster does not take any slots in your weapon. Please excuse our compulsion to point out fairly obvious stuff like that. |

## Extreme Environment Modification

|  |  |
| When you need to keep the cold from freezing the lubricants in your machinery, or when you want to keep sand from getting in every nook and cranny and gumming up the works, this is what you need. This won’t make a weapon work in a place where the basic laws of physics say it won’t function—your flamethrower’s not going to work underwater, no matter how much you tinker with it. There are different levels for this upgrade: Level 1 allows for normal use in polar or desert climates; Level 2 allows for use in all extreme environments. When used in normal atmospheric conditions or underwater, weapons with the Level 2 modification have all range levels cut in half. They also need to be serviced after every 100 rounds fired. This takes 500 nuyen worth of materials and requires an Armorer + Logic (12, 1 hour) [Mental] Extended Test. This modification does not take up any slots in the weapon and requires a tool shop to install. |

## Flashlight

| Because, well, light helps you see. This light is designed to point where your gun is without being obvious; a recessed light source makes it tough for outside observers to see exactly where the light is coming from. Unless you’re directly in its path, in which case you see it to well. If the light’s shining right at you and it’s the type of light that would normally help you, then you get a Weak Glare modifier (p. 175, SR5). There are three kinds of flashlights. Standard flashlights provide Partial Light; |

### Flashlight, Low Light

|  |  |
| low-light flashlights uses a soft red light to help people with low-light vision, moving them up one row on the Environmental Modifiers chart (p. 175, SR5); it is useless to characters without low-light vision. |

### Flashlight, Infrared

| MOUNT | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 6 | 400¥ | SR5:R&G |

|  |  |
| Infrared flashlights work similar to lowlight flashlights, only for characters with infrared vision instead of those with low-light vision. They move the modifier one row up the chart, and they do nothing for people without infravision. |

## Folding Stock

| This is a stock. That folds into the weapon. Got it? It provides 1 point of re coil compensation—but only, of course when it is out and braced against the user’s shoulder. It must be installed in the stock slot and requires a Simple Action to move in or out; there is a motorized version that makes folding and unfolding it a Free Action. |

| This is a handle you put on in the front of the weapon to give you a sturdier grip. It can be mounted on the barrel or underneath slots, and it cannot be used on Pistols and Hold-outs. It provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation and adds 1 to the Concealability of the weapon to which it’s attached. |

| Have trouble holding on to your gun? Then maybe you shouldn’t have one. But if that’s not an option, then try gecko grip, which makes your piece stick in your hand like, well, a gecko hanging on a wall. This gives your grip a bunch of tiny fibers that are awfully clingy to just about anything. The fibers can be turned on and off via wireless command if you have a smartgun—if not, pressing two buttons at the same time does the trick. The mod gives a +6 bonus on any tests to see if a character keeps grip on the gun. This can go on any weapon with a grip, whether they have a stock slot or not; if they have a stock slot, this takes it up. |

| The device that launched a thousand stupid-ass MeFeed videos. Whatever the gun is pointing at, it records. Yeah, you don’t always want a record of what you’re about to shoot, but sometimes that footage is invaluable—whether you need to show Mr. Johnson what you managed to pull off, review footage to help you plan your next move, or doctor what you filmed to make you look good, the video you film has plenty of possible uses. Its Device Rating fills in for any necessary stats. Guncams can be installed in the Top, Underneath, Barrel, Side, or Internal slots. |

| Some weapons are, quite simply, a huge load. This system allows you to move some of the weight of the weapon to your hip, distributing the weight more and letting you brace it better. The end result is that the user gets 1 point of recoil compensation. It uses the stock slot. |

## Improved Range Finder

| Laser range finders are standard equipment on smartlinks, but if you have the scratch you can make its range calculation functions even better. It combines three technologies microwave, laser, and radar—to give you an extremely accurate calculation of range. The effect of this is to reduce range modifiers by 1. This only can be used in weapons that have a smartlink; it can be positioned in any slot besides the one that has the smartlink. This bonus cannot be combined with any bonuses from image magnification on the weapon. |

## Peak-Discharge Battery Packs

For weapons that need a power source, this is it. It does not take up a slot; weapons that need it already have a spot for it. It charges at a rate of 1 power unit per 30 minutes. The number of power units used per shot is listed with each weapon.

These packs come in three forms:

### Peak-Discharge Battery Packs, Power Clip

|  |  |
| power clips, which hold 10 power units and fit into a weapon like a clip would; Many hundreds of hours have gone into testing and refining the makeup of these batteries to make it so they are not susceptible to explosions. So no, you can’t use one as an improvised explosive device. |

## Safe Target System Base

|  |  |
| The goal of this system is to avoid those situations where your mates are chewing you out for accidentally shooting them in the hoop. Using information about your teammates’ appearance and the electronics in their PAN, this system attempts to recognize when you are aiming at any spot within 1 meter of a friendly target. In these situations, the system locks the trigger, preventing you from firing. Once the friendly target isn’t at risk anymore, you can start firing again. Note that the system interprets risk broadly—if there is something between you and a friendly target, the system will lock you out, unless that “something” is an entire office building or Mt. Rushmore or something. The basic system can mark up to 10 RFID profiles (or GPS coordinates if you want to designate fixed locations as “safe”); for a few extra nuyen you can add more profiles. If you want a little more accuracy, allowing you to easily shoot the drekhead who stole your buddy’s commlink without difficulty, then upgrade to the image recognition System. You’ll need a guncam or smartlink to use this function. The base image recognition allows you to enter up to 10 different visual profiles, which can be as broad as “anyone wearing the Ancients’ logo” or as narrow as precise scans of members of your team. As with the GPS/RFID system, you can spring for extra profiles if you need them. The safe target system can be mounted on any location besides the stock. |

| For Special Forces troops, this is a sturdy piece of mesh or canvas custom-fitted to the user and positioned on the weapon in a way to ensure it can be readied as quickly as possible. For guerilla warriors, this might be a piece of rope, and old belt, or anything else that can be rigged up to help them keep from dropping their weapon. No matter how complex or simple, the function is basic—it makes sure your weapon doesn’t fall to the ground when you’re running or diving from an explosion or in the middle of being shot or whatever. It may be shot out of your hands, but getting it ready again is a Simple Action. The sling does not take up any slots on a weapon. |

| This is a customized RFID tag that combines the functions of security and stealth RFIDs, giving you the chance to track down your weapon if for some reason you don’t know where it is. Use the rules for RFID tags, p. 440, SR5; assume the tracker has the function of a security tag and a stealth tag. The tracker does not take up any slots in a weapon. |

| Would your weapon be enhanced by the ability to throw out two balls connected by a thin rope that can entangle and trip up your opponent? If your answer is “no,” please go back and read the questions again. As the name indicates, this goes on the underneath slot, and it can only go on weapons rifle-sized or larger The launched bola works in the same way as a regular bola (p. 27) as thrown by someone with Strength 5. It uses Heavy Pistol ranges, and wielders fire it with the Exotic Ranged Weapon (Bola) skill. |

| Very useful in case you need to chop wood for a campfire while out on a run, or cut some lumber to repair floorboards. Ha! Who are we kidding? This is there for those times when you might want to use a bayonet but would prefer something louder and messier. If you don’t know what times might require that, you haven’t been in the shadows long enough. Use the Exotic Melee Weapons (Chainsaw) skill for this; when used against a barrier, double its Damage Value. It can only be mounted on the underneath slot and must be used on rifle-sized weapons or larger. Sorry for killing your dreams of a chainsaw pistol. |

| It may be a crude way to reduce recoil, but it still works. By placing some weight in the underneath slot of a weapon, you prevent the kick from being as severe as it would be otherwise. This provides 1 point of recoil compensation when using the weapon in Full Auto mode. |

## Weapon Commlink

| Once you get over the idea that using your commlink means touching it all the time, placing one in your weapon becomes a sensible move. Your weapon becomes the heart of your PAN. Many users like to use this with the weapon personality mod. |

| Does your gun need its own software complete with an artificial per sonality to provide information in a more chatty fashion instead of just providing numbers, crosshairs, and other similar data? Depends on how you function. If meta-to-meta interaction is how you prefer to get your information, you might want a weapon personality, which provides a metahuman-like interface so you can chat away. The guttural Neil the Ork Barbarian with its "scalped 'em" grunt to tell you when you got a hit is especially popular. |
