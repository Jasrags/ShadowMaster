Machine guns come in three varieties—light, medium, and heavy—that determine their ranges. All, even the “light” ones, are in fact very heavy and large. A light machine gun is physically bigger and heavier than an assault rifle. MMGs and HMGs could be carried by someone with Strength of 8+ and 10+ (respectively), but they work better as vehicle-mounted weapons. Use the Heavy Weapons skill when firing these weapons. They suffer from double modifiers for uncompensated recoil (Recoil, p. 175). Machine guns can take top, barrel, and underbarrel accessories.

Standard upgrades
:   Gas-vent 2, laser sight, tripod

A common sight on the modern battlefield of the Sixth World, the MAG-5 is often seen as a vehicle-mounted weapon or defending a fixed position. While its overall accuracy is considered slightly sub-par by some, few can deny the raw power of this weapon. A laser sight, gasvent 2 system, and under-barrel tripod come standard.

- Something the marketing department never mentions: the ergonomics on this thing SUCK! Almost everyone I’ve met who uses a MAG-5 modifies the grip in some way, myself included; and not because I’m a troll!

Standard upgrades
:   Slide mounts (top and bottom)
:   Smartgun

Rotate Barrels
:   Users must take a Simple Action to rotate the barrels of the Vindicator before it can fire.

While technically classified as a light machine gun, this six-barreled, belt-fed, rotary lead-spitter is usually mounted on vehicles, drones, or light aircraft. The “Vindi” is also popular with metatypes of a larger stature. Despite the relatively light ammo it uses, the Vindicator has exceptional armor-piercing capabilities and decent recoil management. However, the weapon is also large and cumbersome. Ammo is available in the standard 100 or GE’s custom 200-round belt (not compatible with any other weapon system, cost: 100 nuyen). Operating the Vindicator requires a few seconds for the barrels to rotate before it can fire, which can only be done in the Full Auto mode. A smartgun system also comes standard.

Modifiers

This legendary light machine gun is popular with mercenary units the world over. It comes with a rigid stock with shock pad, a laser sight, and a barrel-mounted gas-vent 2 system.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Bipod, Metahuman Customization

The first squad automatic weapon offered by Krime, the Wave is the result of several years of development—not only in the fields of ballistics and ergonomics, but also in material technology as Krime updated their manufacturing processes to incorporate the right level of thermodynamic dissipation. The Wave features a dual-feed system, allowing the user to switch between a pre-loaded magazine and belt feed as needed. Let the Krime Wave surf you to the places you need to be.

- Interesting weapon. Greece has not yet approved it for use in the Minotaur Legion, and I can’t seem to find any governmental purchasers.
  - Snopes

- I have information the Vory picked up a lot of them for their own use rather than selling them on the street. I had no idea they had recruited so many large metahumans they felt the need to arm them so heavily.
  - Red Anya

- I've attached a couple to a Steel Lynx I’ve been working on. They seem accurate enough to use in military style operations.

Modifiers
:   Detachable Tripod

This heavy Russian machine gun is used by the militaries of several eastern European and Near East countries, primarily as a vehicle-mounted support weapon. Equipped with a detachable tripod, the RPK is usually fired from a prone, sitting, or kneeling position when not mounted on a vehicle.

Standard upgrades
:   Gas-vent 3, hip pad bracing system, laser sight

When the famed mercenary unit MET2000 commissioned Ruhrmetall for a brand-new HMG, they only had two guidelines: make it easy to customize and make it powerful. The result was the SF-20, one of the hardest-hitting HMGs on the planet. The weapon quickly became a mainstay in the MET2000’s mechanized and assault forces. Easy-access construction points allows for easy customization while standard equipment includes a gas-vent system, a hip pad brace, and laser sight.

- As part of their contract with Ruhrmetall, only “select” clients approved by MET2000 could purchase the SF-20. After their recent mauling in South America, they’ve relaxed that policy considerably and dumped several surplus SF-20s on the market to generate emergency revenue.

Standard upgrades
:   Gas-vent 2, Safe Target System (20 RFID data sets, 20 image profiles), smartgun system

Introduced a few years ago by Shiawase Armaments, the Nemesis was designed to be the ultimate support weapon for modern infantry units. While its performance stats are comparable to most other LMGs, the Nemesis stands out because of the various systems that come standard on it. A safe target system with image recognition and one extra set apiece of RFID data and image profiles help prevent friendly fire incidents while the standard smartgun system enhances overall accuracy.

- Expensive, but a damn good investment in my not-so humble opinion. My gunners love this thing and various squads have sometimes paid out-of-pocket to keep them on the TO and E. The safe target systems alone are worth it.

This MMG packs a tremendous punch into a relatively lightweight framework made of extra-durable compounds. Due to its relatively small size, it’s a very popular secondary weapon for heavy military vehicles. Trolls with no concept of subtlety sometimes deck them out with accessories for use as personal weapons.

Standard upgrades
:   Laser sight, tripod

With the success of their standard MMG, Ultamax decided to gain their piece of the HMG market pie. The designers amped up their MMG design and called it the HMG-2. The rushed development coupled with cost-cutting measures resulted in an underpowered and inaccurate base weapon that’s sub par compared to other weapons in its class unless significant modifications are made. Standard equipment includes a laser sight and under-barrel tripod.

- Piece. Of. Drek. I got a case of these as payment for a job, but the first time I used a couple in a fight, I got nothing but malfunctions. Almost got my head shot off.

Standard upgrades
:   Foregrip, Laser Sight, Under-barrel Tripod

Normally associated with militaries and mercenaries units of the Pacific Rim, the Ultamax MMG has made its way into other theaters of operation and saw significant action with units who fought in the recent Amazonia–Aztlan War. During that conflict, units fielding the Ultamax made an impression on both allies and foes alike. Because of its compact and somewhat unknown design, the Ultamax is sometimes mistaken for an LMG or EBR at long distances, much to the detriment of enemy forces. Standard equipment includes a foregrip for maneuvering fire, a laser sight for enhanced accuracy, and a tripod for use when fired in a static position.
