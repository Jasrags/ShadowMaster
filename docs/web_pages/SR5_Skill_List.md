NO RATING
:   **UNAWARE**
:   This is something other than having no ranks in a skill—this is a special level of ignorance. You haven’t the first clue about this skill. This level can only be achieved through a quality (like the Incompetent negative quality, p. 81), or maybe a character history explaining the deficiency. You can’t default the skill, and it never really occurs to you to even use it to solve your problems.

RATING 0
:   **UNTRAINED**
:   The default level of knowledge obtained through interaction with society and the Matrix. Though untrained, you have a general awareness of the skill, and occasionally may even be able to fake it.

RATING 1
:   **BEGINNER**
:   You have a little training about how it works, but not always why it works.

RATING 2
:   **NOVICE**
:   You’re a hobbyist, but not an enthusiast.

RATING 3
:   **COMPETENT**
:   You’re skilled at basic operations but struggle with complex operations and “tricks.”

RATING 4
:   **PROFICIENT**
:   You’re comfortable with what you do and perform well under normal pressures. Professional level for most jobs.

RATING 5
:   **SKILLED**
:   You know how to handle yourself in unfamiliar situations, and can get creative when solving problems.

RATING 6
:   **PROFESSIONAL**
:   You could easily sell your skills on the open market. This is the maximum skill level for starting player characters.

RATING 7
:   **VETERAN**
:   You’ve seen a lot of what the skill can do, and what it can’t. Other people ask you how to do it.

RATING 8
:   **EXPERT**
:   You are a highly sought-after talent. Corporations seek you out (or extract you from other corporations).

RATING 9
:   **EXCEPTIONAL**
:   Your name is synonymous with the skill. If you have multiple skills at this level, you’re lauded as exceptionally gifted.

RATING 10
:   **ELITE**
:   You are famous, even among the very best in your field.

RATING 11
:   **LEGENDARY**
:   You are a paragon to those trying to excel at your skill. Techniques are named after you.

RATING 12–13
:   **APEX**
:   You have reached the pinnacle of mortal achievement. This expertise represents the top 0.00001% of all practitioners in known history. The very highest rating, 13, can only be reached with the Aptitude quality (p. 72).
