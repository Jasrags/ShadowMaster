**MATRIX PERCEPTION**

| When you take a Matrix Perception action, each hit can reveal one piece of information you ask of your gamemaster. Here’s a list of some of the things Matrix Perception can tell you. It’s not an exhaustive list, but it should give you a pretty good idea about how to use Matrix Perception: Spot a target icon you’re looking for. The most recent edit date of a file. The number of boxes of Matrix damage on the target’s Condition Monitor. The presence of a data bomb on a file. The programs being run by a persona. The target’s device rating. The target’s commode. The rating of one of the target’s Matrix attributes. The type of icon (host, persona, device, file), if it is using a non-standard (or even illegal) look. Whether a file is protected, and at what rating. The grid a persona, device, or host is using. If you’re out on the grid, whether there is an icon running silent within 100 meters. If you’re in a host, whether there is an icon running silent in the host. If you know at least one feature of an icon running silent, you can spot the icon (Running Silent, below). The last Matrix action an icon performed, and when. The marks on an icon, but not their owners. |
