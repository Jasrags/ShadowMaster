I originally created this when 5E came out while in college. I read the rule books and felt that they were all over the place and disorganized, knowing that it would be easier to get my friends into it if they had an easy way of navigating the contents of the books with a simple search engine. So in between classes I would sit down with my laptop and copy, paste and reformat the contents of the books. I great deal of effort in particular went into creating the Weapons Lists. I used to simply host this from a small computer behind my desk at home, but now I host using Google Cloud, and the demands of life mean I don't have as much time to keep this wiki up to date with the latest. Due to increase in usage I have also had to upgrade the server that was hosting, which means increased hosting expense. I'm happy to continue paying for this out of pocket, but if you make use of this site then I would be happy to receive any minor donations you are willing to part with to keep it going.
