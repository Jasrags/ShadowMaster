| 4(6) | 7P | – | SA/BF/FA | (1) | 30(c) | 14F | 1,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

Standard upgrades
:   Folding stock, sound suppressor

Remove Case
:   The Executioner takes a Simple Action to remove from the case for conventional usage and removal is required to reload its caseless ammunition.

The Executioner is still the ultimate in concealable firepower for the executive protection professional. The weapon neatly fits down into a specially designed small briefcase, available in a number of different styles and colors (+400¥ per extra case). The weapon can be fired from the briefcase by pushing a concealed stud, or through the user’s PAN with smartlinked versions (+500¥). Recoil penalties are doubled when fired from the briefcase, but the surprise the Executioner provides may be enough to ensure survival. The Executioner also features an integral sound suppressor and an extendable stock for occasions when it is removed from its case.

- A nice thing for people in my line of business, but the best ones never need this kind of firepower.
  - Mihoshi Oni

- I think you underestimate some of the other posters on the board.

## Ares Sigma-3

| 4 (6) | 8P | – | SA/BF/FA | (2) | 50(d) | 7R | 1,000¥ | SR5:GH3 |

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Collapsible Stock, Foregrip, Powered Slide Mount (Rating 2), Smartlink

Ares has released their latest submachine gun design for law enforcement personnel worldwide. The Sigma-3’s unique drum magazine ensures operators have the ability to conduct a forced entry without having to worry about their ammunition supply at critical moments. The integral carrying handle/powered slide mount allows operators options beyond the internal smartlink, allowing optimization to meet tactical necessities. When using the collapsible stock, shooters have consistently exceeded organizational marksmanship standards, proving the quality design and manufacturing techniques.

- According to recent disclosures, Lone Star has purchased more of these than Knight Errant. Apparently their Austin-based units like the enhanced magazine capacity, although it might just be a symptom of the city’s tension.
  - Mr. Bonds

- No, Lone Star just likes spraying bullets whenever they can get away with it. The Azzie-related issues in Austin are just another excuse.
  - Hard Exit

- It’s still surprising Ares went with a drum magazine for a submachine gun. Reloading the drum takes forever without a winding tool, which of course Ares sells separately.
  - Beaker

- Despite what you see on the trid, most firefights during a shadowrun last less than three seconds. The large drum has enough rounds for nearly six seconds of suppressive fire with some left over. If you’re shooting it out with a Lone Star lackey that long, you deserve what you get.

| 3 (4) | 7P | – | BF/FA | 1(2) | 32(c) | 6R | 400¥ | SR5:GH3 |

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Collapsible Stock, Laser Sight

A simple design intended for street officers requiring temporary increases in firepower, the Gladius combines modern electronics with an easy-to-maintain design. The weapon can also be used to equip a hastily raised militia; its simple operation and maintenance requirements make it ideal for citizen-soldiers. The stamped metal receiver is key to the weapon’s strength, while proprietary recoil absorbers ensure accuracy and the electronics package retains calibration.

- I have yet to hear about any law enforcement agencies picking this up. It seems to fail during the shoot-offs most organizations require before adaptation, although not due to jamming issues according to the reports.
  - Beaker

- The “electronics package” is just a laser sight and an ammo counter, although I guess the extra space in the housing is intended for the marketed upgrade packages.
  - Hard Exit

- I’ve seen a number of them purchased by smaller outfits in Africa. Apparently there is a shop in Lalagos that gets them direct from Cavalier for the locals, and they look meaner than the beat-up weapons normally found there.

Modifiers
:   Flashlight (one-step)

This bullpup submachine gun was purpose-built for Corporate Court-controlled Interpol fast-response teams. Its special chamber system provides 1 point of Recoil Compensation, it has an integrated rigid stock, and a flashlight that can be used to reduce darkness penalties by one step (Environmental Modifiers, p. 173). Possession of the FN P93 while not a legitimate member of a Corporate Court force is a crime in most jurisdictions.

| 7(9) | 8P | – | SA/BF/FA | 2 | 36(c) | 16F | 2,300¥ | SR5:R&G |

HK continues to offer the Urban Combat as its high-end
entry into the submachine gun market. The weapon is
entirely constructed with non-metallic components
and is not detectable with traditional MAD sensors.
H&K has spared no expense in the weapon’s construction with an internal smartlink, a fixed sound suppressor, and a customized hydraulic recoil compensation
system. The price of these bonuses is that the weapon
is unable to accept further modifications.

- I met a runner who called himself Killzone2 who carried one of these. He never said where he got it from.
  - /dev/grrl

- He worked exclusively for Ares until he tried to exceed his mission parameters. I heard he eventually ended up in a Lone Star facility.

Ingram Smartgun X: Grade-A bang bang. Famous as the weapon of choice for many legendary street samurai since the 2050s, the Ingram Smartgun comes tricked out with a gas-vent 2 system, a smartgun system, and an integral sound suppressor.

Standard Upgrades/Accessories
:   Metahuman Adaptation

A new telescoping bolt design intended for those needing alternative ergonomics, the Spree is an economic choice for the discriminating shooter. The design is intended to allow for the easy mounting of a wide array of external aiming and tactical aids. While Krime does not currently manufacture such devices, a call to our friendly Customer Service department will provide a number of helpful suggestions based on the caller’s location.

- While I appreciate the attention to the ergonomic details, I’m less appreciative of the poorly manufactured action and barrel. I know they charge extra for a match barrel, but you shouldn’t have to buy it for reasonable accuracy.
  - Mihoshi Oni

- The action is a pretty simple open-bolt, blowback design. The problem really is the barrel’s rifling—the twist rate hurts accuracy at standard combat ranges.
  - Beaker

- They rock in the latest patch to Action Shooter, though, and that’s all that matters to me!
  - Slamm-0!

- With your rumored skillset, I hope that’s the closest you ever get to one.
