## AgHexHex

**AgHexHex**

AgHexHex, more formally known as silver hexamagnohexaphosphate, is a magical alchemical compound found to have a detrimental effect against Awakened creatures capable of transforming into vapor particles (Mist Form), keeping them corporeal.

Trigger: Contact

Effect: Once in contact, if the Potency exceeds the target’s Magic attribute, the Mist Form power is negated completely for the duration of the compound. If the target is using Mist Form when sprayed by AgHexHex, the target forcibly reverts to solid form for that Combat Turn regardless of Potency, causing (Force + 4) Stun damage.

Aftereffect: Nauseated side effect

Required Reagent: Refined silver

## Aqua Fictus

**Aqua Fictus**

| Skill | Threshold | Base Time | Material Cost | Avail | Cost | Source |

A fool’s gold solution that can be used to make false reagents or make an object such as an alchemical preparation or a ritual circle appear to be magical. Aqua fictus looks like a swirling metallic solution that emits occasional flashes of light. Any item coated with aqua fictus appears to glow with a concentrated-mana aura like that of reagents. This trick is difficult to detect. A successful Alchemy + Magic [Mental] (3) Test lets a magician notice the false magic coating on a mundane object. Sales of such items are hit or miss because of the variety of reagents required, and the coating fades entirely after twelve hours. This solution is used in the creation of fake magical items, such as a paper lotus (p. 215).

## Aqua Fortis

**Aqua Fortis**

| Skill | Threshold | Base Time | Material Cost | Avail | Cost | Source |

This substance detects traces of orichalcum and other true elements. An eight-ounce spray bottle can cover one square meter. Any traces of orichalcum left behind, such as from spilled aqua regia, glow gold. Other Awakened elements glow violet. Aqua fortis allows the user to Observe in Detail (p. 165, SR5) to see if orichalcum or other Awakened elements are present. The gamemaster determines the threshold of the test.

## Aqua Regia

**Aqua Regia**

| Skill | Threshold | Base Time | Material Cost | Avail | Cost | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alchemy | 3 | 10 Hours | 85¥ | 5 | 100¥ | SR5:SG |

This solution can dissolve orichalcum without damaging the metal’s magical properties. This makes the material very easy to transport discreetly. Eight ounces of aqua regia can dissolve 1 dram of orichalcum. Aqua regia is a corrosive acid (p. 170, SR5) capable of dissolving any metal. The base Damage Value is 14P with an AP of –4.

To extract orichalcum once it has been dissolved in aqua regia, the magician must subject the solution to near-freezing temperatures. This breaks down the formula and neutralizes the alchemical properties. Once the neutralization begins, the orichalcum begins to precipitate. The aqua regia then vaporizes into yellowish green smoke and dissipates.

## Aqua Vitae

**Aqua Vitae**

More of an alchemist’s joke, aqua vitae is an alcoholic distillation created through alchemical means. Since soy is the prevalent food staple in the Sixth World, alchemists have worked out ways to distill liquor from just about anything (which gives “hair of the dog” a whole new meaning). Such brews are more potent than standard alcohol. Aqua vitae has an Addiction Rating of 4 (p. 414, SR5)

## Astral Powder

**Astral Powder**

| Skill | Threshold | Base Time | Material Cost | Avail | Cost | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alchemy | 4 | 2 Days | 70¥ | 4 | 120¥ | SR5:SG |

Astral powder, also known as fairy dust, is attracted to sustained magic like static cling. Astral powder was developed as an alternative to using FAB (fluorescing astral bacter ia) to detect astral entities, since some consider FAB an environmental hazard regardless of the genetic var iant. Astral powder clings to spir its, astrally projecting beings, wards, and sustained or quickened spells. This allows non-Awakened characters to use an Observe in Detail action (p. 165, SR5) on such things, though the observer will not know exactly what the object is. For example, a person targeted with an Invisibility spell would look no dif ferent under astral powder than an astrally projecting magician would. The dispersal device is a paper sphere preparation, which is learned as par t of astral powder’s formula. This sphere detonates af ter being thrown, and the astral powder contained within disperses a cloud with a three-meter radius.

Since astral powder is physical, it cannot move through other physical objects. If an astral spirit coated in astral powder goes through a wall, the powder stops at the wall. If a sustained spell is dropped, the powder also drops to the floor. Astral powder doesn’t glow like FAB, so visibility modifiers apply. Other conditions, such as rain, wash off the astral powder after a few minutes. Requires Psychometry (see p. 144).

## BDNB

Also known as “Bad Dog! No Biscuit!,” this compound is commonly used for hunting Awakened game.

Trigger: Contact

Effect: Reduce the subject’s Magic attribute by the Force of the compound when the subject uses the Paralyzing Howl power (p. 399, SR5). If the Force exceeds the target’s Magic attribute, the power is negated completely for the duration of the compound.

Aftereffect: Unable to Speak side effect

Required Reagent: Refined hell hound’s tongue (Cynoglossum magiofficinale)

## Fluorescing Astral Bacteria

Science has had some success in cultivating mana-sensitive bacteria strains as part of astral security. Three strains exist: FAB I, FAB II, and FAB III. The first strain dies when an astral form or magical force such as a spell passes through it. In death the bacteria release a chemical that can be seen with UV light. The second strain is dual-natured, making it difficult for astral forms to pass through it, and the displacement can be seen physically. The third strain was a mutation that actively seeks out and feeds on astral forms and can be lethal to dual-natured creatures.

An alchemist can create a magical device that reduces Drain when cast with a spell suited to fetishes (p. 212). Such spells have to be learned specifically with the fetish, meaning that a character would have to learn a spell twice if he wants to cast it both with and without a fetish. An alchemist needs 1 dram of radical reagents to make the fetish functional for magical use. A magician casting a fetish spell either through Spellcasting or Ritual Spellcasting can reduce the Drain Value by 2 (to a minimum of 2).

## Govi

**Govi**

In the vodou traditions, govi are specially prepared clay pots to hold work loa (watcher spirits). The houngan shapes clay into a pot, etches it with images of their mait-tete, and paints it. Since 2057, govi have been created from glass bottles or other modern containers properly designed with vevers (symbolic images of the loa). Other traditions have taken up creating their own versions of govi to contain watchers. These brooches and talismans are marked with spiritual symbols of the magician’s tradition and incorporate a small compartment to contain the watcher.

A govi is created like other preparations, with the govi’s Force determining the Force of the watcher it can contain. Potency reduces by 1 point of Force per week, instead of the customar y 1 per hour. The magician can of fer (Potency x 25) drams of reagents af ter creation to prevent the govi’s Potency from reducing for half a year. This of fer ing can be done ever y six months. Af ter creation, a watcher is created specifically for that govi. Only one spir it can be connected to a govi at a time. In the case of a watcher, the govi keeps the entity suspended within it, allowing the magician to break up the watcher ’s allotted time. It also allows for quick use of a watcher without having to per form the r itual. Releasing a watcher from a govi is a Simple Action.

If a govi is destroyed, the watcher associated with it is also destroyed, whether it was residing in the govi or not. Govi can be found, but the watcher within can only be commanded by the magician who created it. A magician can attune a found govi, but the watcher associated with it is dispelled. Requires Invocation (see p. 147).

## Hand of Glory

**Hand of Glory**

| Skill | Threshold | Base Time | Material Cost | Avail | Cost | Source |

| - | - | - | ¥ | (Force^2)R | 1,500¥ * Force | SR5:SG |

The Hand of Glory is an alchemical formula found in the banned witchcraft book Compendium Maleficarum. This preparation’s lynchpin is the hand of a talented, deceased individual (the formula romanticizes this as the hand of a hanged criminal, but any hand will do). This unique alchemical preparation allows the magician to use the remembered talent of the individual when performing a task. In game terms, the Hand of Glory is tied to one physical Active skill known by the previous owner. The skill is limited by the Force of the ritual instead of any other limit, including Accuracy. Reagents used must be refined quality or better. When triggered, the magician can use the skill for a number of minutes equal to the Potency. The Hand of Glory, once created, is bonded to the magician and cannot be unbound until the Hand is destroyed or used. It also doesn’t lose Potency.

The Hand of Glory can be reused without re-preparing the item, but this requires the magician’s blood (and thus leads down the path to blood magic). Normally an object used in an alchemical preparation can be re-prepared if it hasn’t been destroyed, but the Hand’s talent fades twenty-four hours after being used. In order for the Hand to remember its talent, the magician must take Physical damage with a DV equal to the preparation’s Force, then transfer his blood to the Hand to recharge it. This wound cannot be healed by magic.

The Compendium Maleficarum warns of trying to own more than one Hand of Glory, saying that the Hands may seek vengeance on their creator if not used—idle hands being the devils tools and all that. Requires Necromancy (see p. 143).

Lot’s Curse is a poison made from the Awakened Gomorrah tree, whose fruit causes calcification of flesh and death when eaten.

Trigger: Contact

Effect: The target is subjected to a Petrify spell. Even if the target resists the immediate petrification, the secondary effect is still petrifying the target from the inside. Upon the target’s death, the petrification becomes permanent. If the victim is still alive at the end of the duration, they return to normal.

Aftereffect: Slow Death side effect

Required Reagent: Refined Gomorrah apple

Magecuffs are crafted with glomoss bioluminescent plant that glows in response to magic or astral entities) and a light-triggered shock device. If the cuffs detect spellcasting or astral projection, the cuffs subject the incarcerated individual to a 15S electrical attack (p.170, SR5).

A magemask is a plastic hood and gag that cuts off the incarcerated individual’s line of sight and produces a combination of light and sounds that disorient the magician and deters astral projection. Attempting astral projection while wearing a magemask requires a Willpower + Intuition (4) Test.

## Mana-Sensitive Film Plate

Modern magicians have updated the ancient process of daguerreotype photography, exchanging the essential chemical actions with an alchemical process. The layers of chemicals used are mana-sensitive, derived from various Awakened plants and animals, allowing auras, spirits, and even background count to be recorded on the plate. Mana-sensitive film plates are used with mortis optigrams and quicksilver cameras.

## Mortis Optigram

**Mortis Optigram**

According to an old, oft-ignored theory, in death the eyes record the last moments of life. Necromancers have found good reason to believe this theory, and they can photograph such images on astral film by using a mortis optigram and the eyes of the deceased. The eyes are positioned to face the plate in the camera. As the magician takes the picture, the last thing the eyes saw is captured on the mana-sensitive film plate. The process takes twenty minutes to complete.

The practice of using the mortis optigram varies greatly, as does the use of such an item as legal evidence. In a criminal case, Tír Tairngire treats a mortis optigram no differently than any physical evidence. The UCAS and CAS permits law-enforcement forensic thaumaturgists to create mortis optigrams as part of an investigation, but the image is considered a valid lead rather than evidence. NAN governments don’t allow the creation of mortis optigrams in any instance due to claims that the process is an aberrant ritual. Amazonia is mixed, depending on the severity of the crime.

The mortis optigram is not always a reliable source of information, as the eyes may be closed at the time of death. Other issues include drugs or cybernetics. Note that cybereye replacements cannot be used in a mortis optigram. The resulting image is almost realistic and oddly three dimensional on the mana-sensitive plate. If the deceased suffered from hallucinations, even ones induced by drugs, those hallucinations can appear on the plate. If the deceased had the ability to astrally perceive, astral space may also appear on the plate (see Quicksilver Camera, p. 215). Astral photos from a mortis optigram are not pretty since they are tainted with echoes of pain and emotional turmoil. Requires Necromancy (see p. 143).

## Mystic Restraints

For confining petty Awakened criminals, law-enforcement officers use cuffs and hoods that distract the incarcerated with lights and sounds or use electric shock to keep twitchy fingers in line. For the hardened criminal magicians, however, police use individually tailored mystic restraints. The shape of these restraints acts like acupuncture that restricts the magician’s access to magic. Mystic restraints (cuffs, masks, or jackets) have to be crafted with the Artificing skill, using the same Force requirements as crafting a symbolic link. Permanently creating the restraint requires 1 Karma.

Net hits from the Artificing Test determine the Force of the restraint, and the Force of the restraint reduces the Magic rating of the Awakened individual (including adepts). Adepts restrained this way temporarily lose Power Points associated with Magic loss; they may choose which powers are affected. There are many pressure points to use, but each restraint is limited to how much Magic it can it restrain. While restraints are made for a specific individual, an existing restraint can be attuned to another individual, but it will be half as effective. This requires an Intuition + Magic (5, 1 hour) Extended Test and requires either assensing the subject or having a material link of the subject to be used in attuning the restraints.

The quicksilver camera is a handheld camera with a built-in collapsible tripod. It can hold five mana-sensitive film plates, with only one being exposed at a time. This camera can take an astral photograph in two minutes.

Early astral photography required several hours of exposure, but six years ago, technology and thaumaturgical research reduced the exposure time to only thirty minutes per mana-sensitive plate. These plates allowed anyone to take a picture of the astral world, and while beautiful enough to have a gallery at the MoMA in New York, they capture a very blurry view of astral space. Astral space is very dynamic, so it cannot sit still for thirty minutes. Also, the mana-sensitive plate could be overexposed since mana isn’t tied to light exposure, and whole sets of plates could be ruined if an astral entity moved through the camera during exposure.

To improve the process, alchemists altered the plates so that the Awakened photographer acted as the plate’s catalyst. To take a photo, the photographer removes the cap to expose the plate to visible light and activates the plate’s chemicals to record the astral world. Once activated, the exposure process cannot be stopped, and it completes in two minutes. Moving the camera before the full exposure time ruins the photograph (astrally and visibly). One the exposure time has elapsed, the astral photo automatically develops with a secondary alchemical process.

The shofar, which is a more impressive name than “the horn that scares spirits,” derives from the Judean tradition of exorcism. The shofar’s sound causes spirits to be shaken and leave the area. When using it, make an Opposed Test pitting the spirit’s Force + Willpower against the shofar’s Force x 2. Materialized or manifested spirits that fail the Opposed Test stop what they are doing and retreat back to astral space, wasting the service they are in process of fulfilling. Materialized or manifested free spirits attempt to leave the area as if affected by the Fear power for a number of Combat Turns equal to the shofar’s Potency. Spirits inhabiting a living or nonliving vessel are only distracted by the noise and suffer a –2 dice penalty to all actions for that Combat Turn. The shofar effect is instantaneous, but after activating it, the item disintegrates. The shofar has a longer shelf life than other compounds, as its Potency reduces by 1 per week. Requires Exorcism (see p. 148).

From effigies to drawings, a symbolic link is a representation of a spell’s target. The most notorious of symbolic links are voodoo dolls, which a magician can use to inflict curses upon the individual the doll represents. The magician uses the Artificing skill to create a symbolic link, but the required Force depends on how well the magician knows the subject. The symbolic link is viable for a number of days equal to the net hits in the Artificing Test. The downside to symbolic links is that the object contains the creator’s astral signature while the link remains viable. This means that a voodoo doll can be used as a material link against the creator. Requires Psychometry (see p. 144).
