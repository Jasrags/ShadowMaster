## Ammonium nitrate

| RATING | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 5 | 80¥ per Kg | R&G |

| Ammonium nitrate is regularly used as a component of fertilizer. As such, ammonium nitrate can be easy to acquire legally. However, governments and corporations are well aware that ammonium nitrate can be used in explosives, so they monitor and track the sales of this particular chemical. Buying too much at any given time from a legal source will likely raise red flags that law enforcement will investigate. Because of this, most runners involved in bomb making will acquire ammonium nitrate from black-market sources as opposed to legal avenues. Ammonium nitrate consists of a powder or granules and requires a container to hold it before a detonator can be fitted. Ammonium nitrate will catch fire if set alight, but it will only explode if burned when enclosed in a container. Ammonium nitrate will not detonate when wet. It can be used as an oxidizing agent for other explosives and can also be used to modify their detonation rates. Other chemicals ammonium nitrate has been used with include nitroglycerin. |

## ANFO

| 6 | 7 | 100¥ per Kg | R&G |

| Ammonium nitrate/fuel oil is a binary explosive, combining ammonium nitrate and fuel oil. The two are mixed to enhance the effectiveness of the ammonium nitrate. ANFO is a common commercial explosive used frequently in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. ANFO is considered blaster cap insensitive, so it requires a primer to be detonated, such as a small amount of dynamite or TNT. |

Detonating cord is a thin, plastic tube filled with a small amount of high-grade explosive, with an explosive potential that can be adjusted based on the length of the cord. Det cord, as it is commonly called, can be used on its own, wrapped around an object for use as a cutting charge, or used as a breaching charge to punch a hole in a barrier. It can also be connected to other explosives and used as a means to set off connected charges simultaneously as a high-speed fuse.

Det cord comes in two different sizes: low yield and high yield. Low-yield det cord is often used for special effects in various trideo productions and tends to be used against average material. High-yield det cord is more powerful and can be used on heavier materials. Low-yield det cord has a base Damage Value of 3P per meter; high-yield det cord has a base Damage Value of 6P. For simplicity, add or subtract 1P from the power level of the detonating cord for every one-third of a meter (34cm) added or subtracted to the total length of detonating cord used. For example, if a player only uses one-third of a meter of low-yield detonating cord, the base Damage Value for the detonating cord is 1P.

## Dynamite

| 3 | 8R | 350¥ per Kg | R&G |

| Dynamite is typically packed in sticks weighting 0.25 kilograms each, but individual sticks can be taped together quickly to create larger charges. Dynamite is typically sold per kilogram. Although a powerful explosive on its own, dynamite can also be used as a primer for other explosives, such as ANFO. |

## Foam

| 6-25 | 18F | Rating x 100¥ per Kg | Core |

| Plastic explosives with the consistency of shaving cream, stored in an aerosol can. Perfect for spraying into crevices, and detonated the same way as regular plastic explosives. |

## Linear Charge

| 1-25 | 16R | Rating x 250¥ per Kg | R&G |

| Developed for making precise, clean cuts through material with minimum effort, this is an inverted V-shaped sheath, typically made of lead, copper, or tin, with a layer of high explosive contained within. This device focuses the explosive blast onto the line to be cut, giving much greater penetration of the target material. Linear cutting charges automatically tamp the explosive, giving it the x 4 multiplier when detonated. One meter of cutting charge contains 1 kilogram of explosives of the charge’s rating. Linear cutting charges are normally filled with granular explosives such as RDX, but other high explosives can also be use, including PETN (pentaerythritol tetranitrate). |

## Liquid

| Liquid explosives are frequently referred to as “liquid plastique.” Liquid explosives function identically to plastic explosives, except that liquid explosives can be poured in desired quantities (1 liter is the approximate equivalent of 1 kilogram of plastic explosive). Liquid explosives are available in Ratings 1–25 and are frequently used with an atomizer to maximize damage. |

## Nitroglycerin

| A very powerful explosive that has been around since 1847, nitroglycerin is well known for its instability—it can detonate from mere jolts, let alone other explosions. Any time a character handles nitroglycerin, roll an Agility + Reaction Test—a glitch means that the nitro detonated by accident (the only reason for the test is to see if there is a glitch; the number of hits does not matter). Transporting it in a vehicle requires the driver to make a Vehicle Test, with a glitch setting it off. Have the passengers resist damage from the explosion before having the vehicle resist damage, subtracting any hits the passengers get on their Damage Resistance Tests. If anyone carrying nitroglycerin is knocked down, or if nitroglycerin is falls more than half a meter for any reason, the shock may make it detonate. Roll an Object Resistance dice pool of 8; on a glitch, the nitro accidentally detonates. Follow the same rules for a car explosion found under Car Bombs as Tools for Assassins. Treat 1 liter of nitroglycerin as 1 kilogram of Rating 6 explosives. |

| These highly stable moldable, and adhesive explosive compounds are military grade. They’re ideal for certain jobs, like breaching walls. They are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic-field induction to the chalky white of 440-volt industrial explosives. |

## TNT

| The standard by which all other explosives are measured, trinitrotoluene has been used as an explosive compound for 200 years. TNT is highly regulated and hard to obtain legally without proper permits and licenses. TNT is available in blocks of varying weight that can either be cut up when smaller amounts are needed or taped together for larger charges. Any kind of detonator can be used to set off TNT. |
