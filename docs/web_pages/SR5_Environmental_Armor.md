All around the world (and off of it too) there are places where it’s not bullets and brass knuckles you have to worry about. Armand’s Armor Emporium doesn’t just handle your ballistic protection needs but also offers access to protections from the harshness Mother Nature has to offer. Though I don’t always have all of these pieces in stock, I have connections all over the planet, and even some beyond. Drop an order, send the payment, and I’ll get to work.

# Universal

These few pieces are pretty universal, though they’re often ordered in particular styles to better fit the environment in question.

## Ghillie Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 4 | 6 | 600¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Restrictive Special Rules When hiding in a location for which the suit is customized, a ghillie suit provides a –6 dice pool modifier to Perception Tests to spot the camouflaged character as long as he remains immobile; if the character is moving, reduce the modifier to –2. Wireless Bonus Um … you draw in curious Hackers? |  |
| On the shelf it just looks like a colored netting, but out in the field these suits are the height of simpletech camouflage. They come in styles for all major environments and have even released an urban blight style that helps the wearer hide out in trash filled alleys and the rubble of crumbling buildings. Great for runners and the homeless alike. |

## Ares Armored Survivalist

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | 6 | 10 | 1,500¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (4), decrease Social Limit by 1 Wireless Bonus +1 on all Survival Tests in appropriate Custom Protection terrain. |  |
| Designed to protect from rain and raining lead, this suit is designed for hunters who think they might become the hunted. Originally built off designs for Ares’ various security firms that work in hostile environments, these suits come with a wide array of options, but they leave fashion to the shops in Paris. |

# Heat

## Desert Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3 | 2 | 8 | 1,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit, Flare Compensation Special Rules Desert suits cannot be worn with armor or anything but loose, non-restrictive clothing, as it impedes the suit’s heat sinks from working properly. A character wearing a desert suit receives an additional +2 dice pool modifier to desert Survival Tests (see p. 136, SR5). Wireless Bonus +1 on all Survival Tests in hot terrain. | Couldn’t write this one yourself, Armand? It’s great for protecting from the elements, but don’t catch a bullet in it. It also makes piss-poor camo, but you can bury yourself in the sand for a short stint to duck pursuit. Picador |
| The sealed suit keeps the wearer protected from sand and helps cool the body through heat dissipation while the reflective outer surface protects from the sun’s heat. You need to wear it all—the hood, facemask, and skin-tight suit—for it to be effective. The facemask has a polarizing eye shield to neutralize glare. The suit even captures and distills some of the wearer’s body fluids, holding the water in pockets to be drunk with a straw. |

## Snake Mesh Socks

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| +2 | - | 6 | 50¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Special Rules These socks provide +2 Armor to attacks directed at the feet and lower legs. |  |
| These fashionably disastrous knee-length socks are designed to prevent the penetration of a snake’s fangs. They aren’t the most comfortable socks in the world, but they’ll keep you from finding out what rattlesnake venom feels like in your blood. |

# Cold

## Coldsuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | 4 | 4 | 800¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (Insulation 4), Flare Compensation Special Rules External armor can be layered over the suit, though at the risk of overheating the wearer. Armor over these suits increases the risk of Cold Fatigue damage and incurs a dice pool penalty of –2 on the character due to the difficulty of moving with the layers. Wireless Bonus +1 on all Survival Tests in cold terrain. |  |
| A form-fitting, layered bodysuit designed to keep the wearer toasty and dry, this suit has three layers: an inner layer that transfers moisture away from the skin, a middle insulating layer, and an outer waterproof and windproof shell. The full suit also includes heated boots, a hood, and a facemask with polarizing lenses. Flexible gloves keep the fingers toasty while still allowing for maximum manual dexterity. |

## Polar Survival Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 6 | 8 | 2,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (Insulation 6, Thermal Damping 4), Flare Compensation Special Rules Retractable climbing claws (+1 dice pool modifier to Climbing Test; Attack: DV (STR+1)P, AP —). The suit can be outfitted to include any of modifications available to armor. It cannot be worn with any other armor. Wireless Bonus Increase Physical Limit by 1 for Climbing Tests. | The thermal damping system has saved my life on more occasions than I can count. Out in the cold even the slightest hint of body heat can give you away. Picador |
| This is the serious upgrade from the standard coldsuit. It’s bulky, but all that added bulk offers several extremely useful features. Inside there’s a layer that works like a drysuit and integrates the water reclamation system similar to the desert suit. The parka piece can be extended into a cold-weather sleeping bag and provides flotation as well as integrating a nice thermal dampening suite. It’s got gloves and boots with retractable climbing claws, though they are a bit bulky. The suit provides facial protection with a full-face mask, complete with a no-fog, polarized lens and a heater to make breathing easier. |

## Ares Arctic Forces Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 15 | 14 | 16R | 11,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Insulation 5, Thermal Damping 3), Flare Compensation, Gas Mask, Gear Access Special Rules Retractable climbing claws (+1 dice pool modifier to Climbing Test; DV (STR)P, AP —) Wireless Bonus Increase Physical Limit for Climbing Tests by 1. | This stuff is slowly starting to appear in Chicago as winter nears. Their push to take back the CZ is going to continue, and smart runners will make sure they’re wearing gear like this when working come December. Turbo Bunny So that’s where you’re hanging out. Rigger X This stuff is standard special operations wear for Ares ops beyond 60 degrees latitude. Sticks |
| Leave it to Ares to design a suit that keeps out the cold wind and cold steel. Built from a combination of SWAT armor and the polar survival suit, it provides the same inner drysuit but alters the parka with armor and handy access tabs. The boots and gloves both have the retractable climbing claws but are made of a thinner, more trigger-friendly material. The helmet incorporates a full facemask that comes with a full AR suite, air warmer, and gas mask integrated into the design. |

## Ares Armored Coldsuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | 6 | 6 | 1,200¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Insulation 4), Flare Compensation, Restrictive Special Rules –2 dice pool penalty on all Fatigue Tests Wireless Bonus Fatigue dice pool penalty decreases to –1. | Tough part is, this stuff can’t be used for long-term field operations. The armor makes the suits heavy and strains the wearer whenever they do anything strenuous (though having the wireless on guides you to easier paths and places to step, easing the burden somewhat). And as the wise know, sweat kills in the cold. Stone |
| Tougher than a coldsuit but not up to the Arctic Forces level of protection, this is the standard for security at all bases in cold-weather environments. It’s got all the same standard features as the regular coldsuit, but it adds on some armor for protection for those times when lead joins in the flying snow. |

## Ares Polar Sneak Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 4 | 16F | 10,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit, Flare Compensation, Ruthenium Polymer Coating (Rating 3) Special Rules Modifications are limited and cannot affect the ruthenium polymer coating. What affects the coating is up to the gamemaster’s discretion. | A hot barrel or a momentary muzzle flash is all that gets seen when someone in these suits targets you. Polar snipers love these suits after they’ve put a few mods on their rifle. Picador It’s a lot of money to spend when a snow ghillie is just as good for cover. Hard Exit Maybe when hunting caribou or reindeer, but you get a tech-savvy enemy with thermo and that ghillie suit will look like a flashlight in a dark cave. A little less money and a lot more years on your life seem like a good trade to me. Picador |
| This Ares creation takes the polar survival suit and slips in some ruthenium polymer technology in the form of chameleon coating. A deadly combination that blends the wearer completely into their surroundings. |

# Aquatic

Beneath the waves, metahumanity has at most twelve minutes of life without some additional help. Even that period of time is only if they sit their calmly, do nothing, and have years of training in how to hold their breath. For any other situation, especially when some of the Sixth World’s newest residents come to play, they’ll need a little extra help.

## Enclosed Breathing Helmet

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | 6 | 8 | 900¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Halogen headlamp, external speakers, dataport, low-light vision modification Wireless Bonus Transmits environmental information. | Really? You carry these? Interesting that you include runners in the description even though runners would be ill advised to use an external speaker system under water. Sound travels a long way. Sounder It’s useful. That’s all I care about. How it’s used is for folks on the other end of the transaction to worry about. Armand |
| This diving helmet is designed for commercial divers who require unrestricted verbal communication to perform their jobs or runners who want to talk to coordinate their operations, all of whom are forced to rely on twentieth-century tech (by contrast, trodes could make communication mental while not leaving the user’s head inside a fragile gas-filled bubble). Hoses on the back of the helmet connect into an air-supply tank, or a variable gas mix for deep operations. Speakers and audio pickups built onto the outside allow communication even when signals are too weak due to water and distance. Most helmets include a headlamp and low-light vision enhancements as well as internal and external connections needed for data transfers. |

## Full Face Mask

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | 4 | 8 | 300¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Gas mask Wireless Bonus Transmits environmental information. |  |
| The shallow-dive little brother of the breathing helmet, this piece of gear offers accessory plugs for communication systems, voice microphones, or other add-ons in addition to the dual hoses for air from a tank. Though unwieldy, the full face mask also doubles as protection against gas attacks. |

## Drysuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | 4 | 6 | 2,500¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Drysuits feature a Chemical Seal (with the hood up and face mask attached), Custom Protection (Insulation 4) Wireless Bonus Transmits environmental information. |  |
| Drysuits enclose the diver in a sheath of air, sandwiched between an outer layer keeping out the water and an inner layer snug against the skin. Because drysuits work even more effectively in heat insulation than wetsuits, divers use them for dives in Arctic waters or for dives greater than 200 meters that would last extended periods of time. |

## Diving Armor

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | 4 | 6 | 1,750¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (Chemical Protection 4), –2 dice pool penalty to Swimming Tests Wireless Bonus Transmits environmental information; Swimming Test penalty is only –1. | Armor tech is not known for buoyancy so make sure you actually know how to swim if you put this stuff on. Sounder |
| Looks like a wetsuit, protects like armored underwear. |

## Arctic Diving Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 4 | 8 | 3,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (Insulation 8, in water only) Special Rules The suit will keep the diver warm for a forty-five-minute dive before any tests need to be made. It has to be recharged in between dives; charging takes two hours. Wireless Bonus Extend the warm diver time to 1 hour | Nanotech?! Do people still buy these? Butch Not everyone believes all the rumors they hear. Anyway, it’s a heater, not some invasive nanotech treatment. Stop rumormongering and bothering my customers. Armand |
| This stuff takes drysuit tech to the next level. Intended to be used in the freezing waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, this suit adds a nanotech heater under the inner layer to keep the skin warm. |

# Space

| *Seriously Armand, fraggin’ spacesuits? What kind of runners do you think we are? This is real life, not some action trid. Bull You’re not my only customers. Armand |

Not to brag, but I truly have connections all over the place, even off-planet. These aren’t my best-selling pieces, they usually take a little time to get, and I often need to get some measurements to assure proper fit, but Armand’s Armor Emporium is committed to offering a full range of gear!

## Evo HEL Suit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 8 | 5 | 10 | 3,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Protection (Insulation 4, Fire Resistance 2, Radiation Shield 3, Chemical Protection 2), Custom Fit, Gas Mask Wireless Bonus Records and transmits environmental information. | Straight from the Evo catalog! Armand, you’re getting lazy. Slamm-0! |
| The HEL (Hostile Environment Living) is the everyday dress of space-station inhabitants and astronauts. The thin, tight-fitting, puncture- and-tear-resistant suit covers the whole body except the face, which can be protected by a hood and self-attaching breath and eye mask with an internal five-minute supply of highly compressed air that is usually carried within one of the suit’s many pouches. The suit is made of some of the most advanced clothing materials available, offering limited vacuum protection, as well as protection from hot or cold environments and chemicals. Due to its many useful traits and high comfort, the suit has become increasingly popular with people working in uncomfortable earthbound surroundings as well (at least those for whom the suit’s high price is no obstacle). |

## Spacesuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 12 | 6 | 16 | 12,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Biomonitor, Commlink (Device Rating 3), Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Insulation 6, Thermal Damping 4), Flare Compensation Special Rules Spacesuits require an Agility + Reaction (12, 1 minute) Extended Test to put on. Due to the potentially lethal hazard caused by a mistake in putting on a suit, they come with alarms and warning systems. Glitches cost time or have some other non-lethal effect, while critical glitches can be life-threatening but should not result in the instant death of the vacuum of space. The spacesuit’s builtin oxygen upply lasts for twelve hours. The power supply lasts for twenty-four hours before it needs recharging. Spacesuits require one hour of maintenance for every twelve hours of use. If a spacesuit doesn’t get this maintenance, roll 1D6 each time it is used. On a roll of 1, the suit develops a potentially fatal failure: a cracked seal, an air leak, temperature or power failure, etc. Increase the likelihood of a failure by 1 for every additional 12 hours of use without maintenance (the suit fails on a 1D6 roll of 1 or 2 after 24 hours, and so on). Spacesuits come equipped with five emergency slap patches (additional patches cost 50¥ each). No other armor can be worn with a spacesuit, but the suits can be equipped with armor add-ons and modifications. Wireless Bonus Records and transmits environmental information. |  |
| If you need one of these, you best know all the specs of the suit and then some, but they tend to design these suits with the lowest common denominator in mind. I carry basic models from all the major manufacturers, each with a basic list of features that align pretty well with each other—generally a life-support system, biomonitor, commlink, standard polarized face shield, and a liquid canteen built in for hydration during standard operations. Don’t get in a tussle in one of these—any damage will threaten the integrity of the suit and result in the death of the user shortly after they hit the vacuum of space. |

## Security Spacesuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| Features As spacesuit Wireless Bonus Records and transmits environmental information. | Are there really runners dumb enough to get into a fight in a vacuum? Sunshine Usually not for long! Slamm-0! |
| A standard spacesuit for use by security personnel or runners looking to test whether it really is such a bad idea to get into a fight in space. |

## Evo Armadillo Armored Spacesuit

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | 10 | 24R | 35,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit, Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Fire Resistance 4, Insulation 6, Thermal Damping 4), Enhanced Strength (+2 Strength for Climbing or Lifting, but not on Attack Damage) Special Rules As Spacesuit. Self-sealing system prevents one breach (the suit automatically reseals if a breach occurs, but only once). Post-operation repairs requires a Logic + Armorer [Mental] (6, 1 hour) Extended Test. Wireless Bonus Records and transmits environmental information. | All of these suits look like something out of a sci-fi trid except they aren’t really battle-hardened, just lightly bullet-resistant. Holes may be patched up by Evo’s tech, but I wouldn’t wear a repaired suit—any structural weakness at all increases your risk of death by exposure to vacuum. Orbital DK Not to mention death by exposure to nanites. Or something worse than death. Plan 9 Are you admitting you’re worse than before? Orbital DK |
| This one is kind of neat. With rumors of alien life on Mars, Evo made this little contribution to the SRS (Space Rescue Service). It’s like the security spacesuit, but Evo added an exo-frame and servo motors. It’s also got extra shielding against radiation and electrostatic discharges, which can be dangerous on the surface of Mars. The Armadillo also offers additional protection from suit breaches, thanks to Evo’s BreachBuster™ technology. I’ve also got the new scaled-down version, which is offered to the general public—or at least the part of the general public that can afford to drop tens of thousands of nuyen on a suit for a place only a few metahumans will ever go. |

## Magnetic Boots

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| — | 4 | 12 | 2,500¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Features Custom Fit Special Rules Movement in these boots is limited to 1/4 of normal movement rate, with no Sprint Tests allowed. Climbing Tests receive +3 for wearers of these boots, but climbing takes place at half the normal pace. | They can work in regular gravity too, but don’t trust them to hold you completely against gravity. These with some gecko tape gloves make scaling buildings easier, even if you do have to climb facing out. Mika |
| In places that lack gravity, sometimes it’s nice to just be able to stick to one place or walk around without using your hands. Magnetic boots are the answer. A combination of electromagnets and tiny suction cups make adhesion to virtually any surface possible. |

## Survival Bubble

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 4 | Rating x 3 | 2,000¥ | SR5:R&G |

| Special Rules The bubble takes one Combat Turn to inflate around the user(s). The sphere features transparent windows, an airlock, 24 hours of oxygen per person each point of Rating (meaning a Rating 2 bubble can provide either 24 hours of oxygen for two people or 48 hours of oxygen for one person), emergency food and water rations, a homing beacon (100 kilometer range), and a medkit (Rating 4). The Rating of the bubble is how many people it will hold (maximum 6). Wireless Bonus The homing beacon transmits supply levels to rescue personnel. |  |
| This self-inflating mylar bubble is designed for escape and survival in the case of emergency decompression. Or for rich people to entertain themselves rolling down hills, or floating in the ocean. None of those uses are the intended purpose for this thing, but if you’re creative you can find other uses, even ones that take place on terra firma. |

## MCT EE Suit

| ARMOR | CAPACITY | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

| Features Custom Protection (Chemical Seal, Fire Resistance 4, Radiation Shielding 6). Wireless Bonus Record and transmits environmental information |  |
| While Evo has focused on spacesuit design due to their extraterrestrial intentions, Mitsuhama has been designing ways to protect themselves from the messes they keep leaving all over the planet. This is one such effort—it’s a full-body, extreme-environment suit from Mitsuhama and it’s worn by those who deal directly with hazardous materials/environments, especially chemical and biological agents or radiation. |
