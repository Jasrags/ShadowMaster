For a quarter of a century now, cyber-implant melee weapons have been the classic, favored toys of razor guys, from street muscle to professional urban samurai. They are available as cyberarm upgrades, but can also be installed directly into the flesh. Cyber weapons can be readied via muscle flexture, neural impulse, or wireless signal. Attacks with cyber melee weapons use Unarmed Combat skill and the Physical limit.

Cyber-implant weapons can be installed into cyberlimbs or directly into the meat. They’re popular with the denizens of urban wastelands like the Barrens, and with street samurai who never want to go anywhere unarmed.
