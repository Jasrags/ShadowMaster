# Vehicle Equipment

The following are not considered modifications to the vehicle since they do not integrate into the systems of the vehicle in a significant way. They are standard pieces of equipment that can be purchased and easily installed or used.

## Rigger interface

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 1,000¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| When added to a vehicle, this lets you use a control rig to jump in and control it directly through immersive virtual reality. The standard rigger interface allows the vehicle to be controlled with either a direct fiber-optic cable or wireless link. See Being the Machine, p. 265. |

## Standard weapon mount

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8F | 2,500¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| Vehicles may be equipped with a number of weapon mounts equal to their unaugmented Body ÷ 3 (round down). Standard weapon mounts may hold any assault rifle or smaller-sized weapon and 250 rounds of ammo. |

### Heavy weapon mount

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 14F | 5,000¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| Heavy weapon mounts count as two weapon mounts and can hold any weapon and up to 500 rounds of belted ammo or up to Body rockets/missiles. All weapon mounts are operated remotely and can target a ninety-degree arc of fire (horizontal and vertical). |

### Manual operation

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| +1 | +500¥ | Core |

|  |  |
| Manual operation can be added, but only for vehicles, not drones, and at extra cost. |

## Morphing License Plate

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

|Description=While most modern governments primarily use electronic identification for vehicles, they still require some sort of physical identification plate to uniquely identify a vehicle. Since being positively identified is something that an average shadowrunner wants to avoid, most install a special morphing license plate. Made from smart materials, a morphing license plate can reshape itself with a Complex Action and mimic any of the forms used in governments around the world today. Runners will typically also purchase a spoof chip keep their vehicle from being identified.

## Spoof Chip

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8F | 500¥ | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| All governments in the civilized world require that a vehicle be uniquely tagged and broadcast that identification on demand. This allows law enforcement and any authorized government agency (and some unauthorized) to quickly identify and track a vehicle. All of that may sound great to the common wageslave, but those are all things that a shadowrunner wants to avoid like a VITAS plague. Consequently, installing a spoof chip has become a common practice for anyone wanted to use a vehicle for their shadow activities. The spoof chip mimics a standard vehicle identifier chip but can be command with a Complex Action to change its identifier to a different random value that is arithmetically generated to appear authentic. Installing a spoof chip requires a Hardware + Logic [Logic] (2) Test. |

## Road Strips

Road strips use a myomeric rope to stretch out over a length of about fifteen meters (approximately four lanes of traffic) in order to cause some effect on the vehicle(s) that drive over it.

### Spike Strip

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8R | 200¥ | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| This strip consists of sharp, penetrating spikes that damage the tires of any vehicle that drives over it. The vehicle’s tires immediately blow out unless they are run flat tires (see below), forcing the driver to make an immediate Vehicle Test to avoid crashing. Even if the crash is avoided, flat tires give a –2 dice pool penalty on Vehicle Tests. |

### Zapper Strip

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 12R | 2,500¥ | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| The zapper strip is equipped with hundreds of tiny “feelers” that extend upward to brush against the chassis of a vehicle that passes over. When a vehicle drives over it, the strip sounds a powerful electromagnetic pulse into the chassis of the vehicle, attempting to damage its electronics. A vehicle that drives over a zapper strip suffers 10 DV(e) damage. A zapper strip has enough power for 10 discharges before needing to be recharged. |

### Tracking Strip

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 8R | 600¥ | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| The tracking strip is a subtle way to gather information about vehicles that pass by. Once deployed, whenever a vehicle passes over a tracking strip, it “fires” a that attaches itself to the vehicle. A tracking strip contains fifty stealth tags. |

## Special Tires

Tires are one of the easiest ways to customize a vehicle. The following tires are available for all wheeled ground craft. Changing tires requires a Automotive Mechanic + Logic [Logic] (4, 5 minutes) Extended Test; or you can get your brother-in-law to do it for a case of beer, though that tends to take longer.

### Off-road Tires

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 400¥ /tire | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| Designed specifically for rough terrain, these tires are not as effective as standard tires on standard roads. When equipped, the vehicle’s off-road Handling is increased by +1, and on-road Handling is reduce by –1. Off-road tires are also considered Run Flat Tires. |

### Racing Tires

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6 | 250¥ /tire | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| The flip-side of off-road tires, racing tires are designed to maximize vehicle performance in urban conditions. When equipped, the vehicle’s on-road Handling is increased by +1 and off-road Handling is reduced by –1. |

### Run Flat Tires

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 4 | 250¥ /tire | SR5:R5.0 |

|  |  |
| A common upgrade for shadowrunners, run flat tires are filled with a dense but flexible foam instead of air. They continue to operate even when the tire has been punctured but will quickly deteriorate if the tire suffers significant structure damage. |

## Tool Kit

It never hurts to be prepared! A smart vehicle owner will purchase at least an Automotive Mechanic in their vehicle to affect emergency repairs, and possibly others if the vehicle has more exotic equipment.

# Power Train Modifications

## Acceleration Enhancement

### Acceleration Enhancement R1

|  |  |
|  |

Using a variety of techniques, like adding fuel accelerants (such as nitrous oxide), turbochargers, optimized air intakes, afterburners, or hydrofoil drives, the acceleration of a vehicle is increased. Due to inherent limitations in a vehicle’s design, its acceleration performance can only be increased so far. In the end, though, there’s nothing like going from zero to gone before you get shot. Acceleration enhancement can be taken at Rating 1 or 2, with the Rating of the modification being added to the vehicle’s Acceleration value.

## Gecko Tips

### Gecko Tips (Body 1–3)

Using cutting-edge technology, the portion of any vehicle that contacts a surface can be made to strongly adhere to that surface. With the gecko tips modification, small vehicles can be made to literally climb walls or adhere to surfaces at an extremely sharp angle. The larger and heavier a vehicle is, the more extensive the modifications that are necessary to make the gecko tips system work. There are definite limits to the technology however, as it can only practically be installed on small mass vehicles and still allow them to move. If the gecko technology was applied to larger vehicles, they would literally rip away chunks of the surface they were adhered to if they tried to move. A vehicle installed with gecko tips can move on surfaces with angles that would otherwise be impossible, including vertically.

## Gliding System

For those rare but frightening times when you find your (non-flying) vehicle plummeting to the ground, you’ll thank the Great Ghost you installed a gliding system. The gliding system deploys a large-scale parachute and uses a series of small thrusters installed on the hull of the vehicle to provide limited maneuverability while descending. For vehicles with an exceptionally large mass, there is an upgraded system that uses other methods, including multiple parachutes and retro-thrusters, to slow the descent. While the system allows a vehicle to fall and not be utterly destroyed, the landing is far from graceful. When it lands, the vehicle takes (Body / 2) damage just as if it had crashed (p. 201, SR5). Owners planning on using the gliding system on a regular basis will often install a Passenger Protection System (see p. 159). After it has been deployed, the parachute(s) in the gliding system can be released with a wireless or manual command. Repacking the parachute(s) for reuse is a manual process requiring about one hour.

## Handling Enhancement

By adjusting the suspension and/or adjusting the workings of control systems, a vehicle can be made more responsive to manual or electronic controls. This can range from optimizing control system response times, to more dramatic changes like gyroscopic stabilizers, or destabilizing the structural integrity of the hull. Handling enhancement can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating added to the Handling (both on-road and off-road) of the vehicle.

## Improved Economy

| With this modification, the fuel consumption of the vehicle has been optimized to use the minimum amount necessary for standard operation. Additionally, the vehicle is fitted with a variety of different means to gather operational power from the environment around it including sunlight, static electricity, and wind. A vehicle with improved economy doubles its operational time as long as it is operating within normal parameters—no high speed chases. |

## Manual Control Override

|  |  |
| For runners that are extra paranoid about the Matrix security on their vehicle (or just unwilling to pay for it), they can install a manual control override system. Nearly every modern vehicle made in the 2070s has the ability to be piloted remotely or purely through its electronic controls as well as its manual/mechanical controls. If a rigger is really nervous about those electronic controls being taken over, they can install a switch so that the manual controls will always take priority over the electronic ones. In order to prevent the switch from being remotely deactivated, it is always mechanical in nature with the physical pressing of the button making or breaking connections to ensure the precedence of the manual controls. In game terms, when manual control override is activated, piloting a vehicle via AR or VR is not possible. The system can only be activated by someone physically in the vehicle, within reach of the switch (usually the driver’s seat), and by using a Free Action. |

First, a portable plasma furnace is installed on the vehicle that can render small quantities of matter down to its constituent parts. Then, the vehicle’s engine is modified to be able to consume the raw material output of the plasma torch. This allows nearly any matter to be fed into the vehicle as fuel. A vehicle with a multifuel engine can always be refueled as long as there is raw material around to be processed. |  |

| For those that like to make their own roads rather than follow them, there is the off-road suspension. Most modern vehicles are designed to operate on a smoothly prepared road and do not respond well out of that environment. With an off-road suspension, a vehicle’s suspension system has been replaced with one designed to operate in more rugged environments. The downside, however, is that the vehicle loses some of it responsiveness when operating in regular on-road environments. A vehicle with an off-road suspension has +1 Handling when driving off-road, but –1 Handling on-road. This stacks with bonuses from off-road tires. |

| Riggers who are completely confident in their Matrix skills and security but worried about their lack of physical security will often add a removed manual controls modification. Almost all vehicles in the 2070s are capable of being piloted by either electronic or manual controls. With this modification, the owner simply removes the option for manual controls, relying entirely on the electronic ones. Anyone wishing to pilot the vehicle who is not the owner must succeed on a Control Device Matrix action (p. 238, SR5). |

| For riggers, there is no safer place where they would leave their body than a rigger cocoon. Generally built into the driver’s seat of a vehicle, the cocoon is designed solely for the safety and comfort of someone who’s consciousness is going to be somewhere other than their body. The cocoon has ballistic cloth and hard armored plating for physical protection, is fire resistant, has its own oxygen supply, and carries a host of biomed sensors to monitor the occupant’s condition. Additionally, the cocoon has a variety of safety systems to keep the occupant safe through the most extreme vehicle maneuvers and even crashes. Getting into a rigger cocoon takes about a minute, but it can be exited with a Complex Action using a quick-release system. Treat the rigger cocoon as a barrier with an Armor of 12 and Structure of 8 (p. 197, SR5). The occupant of the rigger cocoon receives +6 dice to resist damage from crashes or other vehicle maneuvers. |  |

| Vehicle operators who are truly daring (or have a death wish) cannot resist installing a rocket booster. This extreme modification installs a high-powered rocket propulsion system to allow the vehicle to make short jumps over intervening terrain or obstacles. That could be a gap in an unfinished road for a ground vehicle, or a dyke or dam that a boat might attempt to leap over. For aircraft, this allows them to take off with half the normal required distance. The rocket is angled to generate an upward lift of about 5 meters, similar to a jump ramp, allowing the vehicle to clear an object or gap about the size of a semi trailer or train car. The gamemaster should have the driver make a Vehicle Test with a difficulty they feel appropriate for the jump. Activating the rocket system takes a Complex Action and is in no way subtle, but it is spectacular. When landing the vehicle must resist (Body) DV damage, following all of the rules for Crash damage (p. 201, SR5). Additionally, the driver must make an immediate Vehicle Test to maintain control. If successful, the vehicle can continue driving as normal, but if it is failed the vehicle crashes. |

| Does your team have a backseat driver who’s always wanting to take control? Or maybe your always sitting in the vehicle of teammate and wishing you had your own gas control so they would just get moving? Both of those problems can be solved with the secondary manual controls modification. This modification literally provides a second set of manual controls that can be used to pilot the vehicle, just like the primary set. Either set can control the vehicle, but the primary set always has priority. If the vehicle also has manual control override, the system can be set to switch only when a manual switch is activated. Secondary manual controls are useful for teams that may need a secondary person to control a vehicle while the driver is otherwise occupied or particularly vulnerable. |

## Secondary Propulsion

**Secondary Propulsion Modes**

| NAME | HANDLING | SPEED | ACCEL |

| Amphibious (Surface) | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Amphibious (Submersible) | 2 | 2 | 2 |

### Secondary Propulsion (Amphibious)

There are times when only the most dramatic action will break off a pursuer, and having your vehicle ditch into the water and keep going is definitely a dramatic action. An amphibious operation package is a dramatic modification that allows the vehicle to travel on water (if it didn’t already have the means to do so). The modification comes in two versions, surface and submersible, depending on how far the owner wants to take the modifications and what the needs are for water travel.

#### Surface

|  |  |
| With the surface version, the vehicle is able to float on top of the water. This could involve a variety of systems including a secondary hull shaped to displace an appropriate amount of water, inflatable skirts or ballasts that expand to create flotation, or pontoons attached to the hull of the vehicle. Regardless of the exact form, the modification is fairly extensive, and it is immediately obvious to any observer that something dramatic has been done to the vehicle. When operating on water, the vehicle can use its normal means of propulsion or a low-powered propeller. If the latter is used, speed and maneuverability are fairly limited, but the vehicle at least functions. It probably wouldn’t do well crossing an ocean or large lake, but it can easily get across a river, sound, or bay. |

#### Submersible

|  |  |
| With the submersible version, the vehicle has been modified to operate under the water. This modification is much more extensive but also more subtle than the surface version. Seals are put in to make sure the vehicle and its essential components are watertight. A secondary propulsion system is then installed to allow it to move while submerged. Classically, this means a propeller powered by the vehicle’s drive train, but it can also be a ducted waterjet system for those that like later technology. Finally, internal or external ballast tanks/balloons are added so that the vehicle can control its depth. While the vehicle is capable of moving underwater, it does not handle extreme conditions well and can only handle depths of about 100 meters. |

### Secondary Propulsion (Hovercraft)

| A well-traveled rigger knows that lots of areas in the world have demanding terrain. Plus, the work of a runner means that they often need to take the path less traveled. For a truly versatile vehicle, there is the hovercraft upgrade. As with all secondary propulsion systems, this is an extensive upgrade that adds an entire alternate means of motion to the vehicle. A large rubber skirt is added all around the vehicle that can be inflated on demand. Steering and control mechanisms are added so that the vehicle can be directed while hovering, which usually involve using compressed air or expanding gas. While hovering, the vehicle only lifts a few centimeters off of the ground, but it can travel across water. Maneuvering is sluggish compared to most standard modes. |

|  |  |
| Another in the line of secondary propulsion modes, the tracked mode is the ultimate in conquering off-road terrain. This ingenious modification features a system where jacks are deployed to lift the vehicle off the ground, then the tires (or other regular propulsion) are retracted partially into the body, and the tracks are deployed. Finally, the jacks are retracted, and the tracks become the means of propulsion. Smugglers that use a watercraft as their primary vehicle have found this system extremely helpful in allowing their boat to make short excursions into the typically rugged terrain frequented by smugglers. Others who have installed them in ground craft do so because they find other methods of off-road travel not good enough, or they want the versatility of being able to switch from a primary on-road system to the tracked system without making a sacrifice to either. When moving in tracked mode, a vehicle can move through extremely rough terrain without issue, including crossing trenches and climbing steep angles. Gamemasters should reduce driving difficulty as appropriate. Though the vehicle’s speed is limited, it can pivot on the spot since both tracks can move forward or backward independently. |

## Secondary Propulsion (Walker)

|  |  |
| For truly exceptional or demanding terrain, some riggers install a walker system of secondary propulsion on their vehicles. Using a variable number (four to eight, as needed) of retractable mechanical legs, the vehicle can deploy the system to give the vehicle the versatility and mobility of a walker. When deployed, the body of the vehicle is lifted about a meter off of the ground to provide clearance from the terrain, with each leg able to move backwards or forwards independently to provide a walking motion. When in walker mode, a vehicle is able to traverse far more rugged terrain than any other propulsion and still be highly maneuverability, though its speed is severely limited. When using the walker mode of secondary propulsion, the vehicle uses those stats for Handling, Speed, and Acceleration. Additionally, while in walker mode, the vehicle has the basic maneuverability of a metahuman meaning it can stop instantly and pivot on the spot. |

Using a variety of techniques and equipment (depending on the vehicle), including things such as superchargers, fuel distribution optimization, and parts replacement, the top speed of the vehicle is increased. More dramatic increases in top end speed require more extensive modifications to the vehicle as it is pushed far beyond its original design and limitations. Some designs can only be pushed so far. In the end, though, having that raw top-end speed can save your hoop. Speed Enhancement modification can be taken with a Rating of 1 to 3, with the Rating adding to the Speed attribute of the vehicle.

# Protection Modifications

Protection modifications are all based around providing various defensive measures for the vehicle or its occupants.

## Anti-Theft System

No self-respecting rigger wants to let their precious vehicle be stolen by some gutter punk with a screwdriver. The anti-theft system modification provides a variety of protection options, depending on the level rating.

### Anti-Theft System (R1)

Need to protect your vehicle? Then give it some armor! Vehicle armor comes in two varieties: standard and concealed. **Standard** vehicle armor is additional plating bolted or welded to the exterior—crude but incredibly effective. However, it is immediately obvious to any observer that the vehicle has a bunch of extra plating slapped on to it. While that will win a runner some points in the barrens, it may not sit too well with security forces in downtown. **Concealed** armor is installed in such a way as to be noticeable only to a trained observer (Perception (4) Test), but does not allow nearly as much protection to be installed. A vehicle must choose the standard or concealed option for all additional armor taken—there cannot be some armor of one time along with some of the other. Regardless of type, each point taken for this modification adds a point to the vehicle’s Armor value for Damage Resistance Tests. The most armor any vehicle can add is equal to vehicle Body (meaning maximum armor=Body + existing armor Rating). This is true even if there are remaining modification slots on the vehicle.

## Passenger Protection System (Rating 1-6)

| The passenger protection system (PPS) is a well known and trusted series of systems and modifications made to a vehicle to keep its passengers safe in the case of a collision or other “adverse vehicular situations.” PPS components include four-point harnesses, padded surfaces, quick-deploying air bags, and in some cases fast-drying foam. A PPS has a Rating of 1 to 6, with the Rating added as dice pool bonus to any Damage Resistance Tests by passengers from damage due to crashes or any other vehicular activity (including ramming) that is not an attack by a weapon. |

Personal armor is a modification that adds additional ballistic protection to the occupants of a vehicle in the form of protective lining, ballistic cloth, and ricochet-reducing materials. The modification has a Rating of 1 to 10, with each Rating point adding to the armor used in Damage Resistance Tests for damage to passengers from attacks originating outside the vehicle. |

The modification may be taken multiple times, providing more rounds for different weapons or even multiple times for the same weapon (if you really need a lot of bullets). |

## Drone Racks

A drone rack is an indispensable tool for a rigger who relies on drones to accomplish critical tasks for their team. Drone racks consist of a metal framework or harness designed to allow for quick and easy deployment of a drone in an instant, turning a vehicle equipped with several of them into a powerful, multipurpose drone carrier. Any drone carried in any kind of drone rack can be deployed by spending a Complex Action, or Simple Action if it is wireless enabled. Each drone rack can carry a single drone of a maximum size depending on the size of the rack. Additionally, each drone rack can be standard or landing type.

All **standard** drone racks deploy drones as above but require a manual process to re-embark the drone. This involves physically putting the drone back into the rack, a process that takes about one minute per drone.

**Landing** drone racks have a mechanic or electromagnetic grapple system that can automatically re-embark a drone that is directly beneath or adjacent to them with a Complex Action. This can even be done while the the vehicle is in motion, as long as the target drone can match the vehicle’s speed.

**Micro** drone racks can hold up to ten micro drones, **mini** drone racks can carry a drone of up one Mini size, **small** drone racks can carry up to one Small drone, **medium** drone racks can carry up to one Medium drone, and **large** drone racks can carry (you guessed it) up to one Large drone.

| For those times when you want your vehicle to be less “car” and more “armored personnel carrier,” there is the gun port mod. A gun port is a small flap or slot installed strategically in the hull of the vehicle that allows a single passenger (or the driver, if you can multitask) to shoot a hand-held weapon at a target outside the vehicle, while still staying completely protected by the vehicle’s armor. The port provides a ninety-degree cone of visibility, and a small stability harness that provides 4 points of Recoil Compensation. The gun port mod can be taken as many times as possible for the vehicle, though provides no benefit beyond the amount of passengers that a vehicle can reasonably carry. |

| While this item normally reserved for military use, a resourceful and properly connected shadowrunner has been known to get their hands on a missile defense system (MDS). Using a highly complicated and specialized set of software, the system ties in control of one or more on-board weapon systems to shoot down incoming missiles and rockets while in flight. The system requires the vehicle to have a Sensor rating of 5 (minimum) and at least one weapon capable of Full-Auto fire, or a laser weapon, to be attached via remote control turret weapon mount. When an incoming projectile is detected, the system takes control of all weapons tied into it in order to intercept in the incoming projectile. This supersedes any other current controller of the weapon(s). Ballistics weapons use 20 rounds of ammunition each time the system activates. In game turns, each ballistic weapon tied into the system gives the defender +2 on Defense Tests made against missiles and rockets. Each laser weapon provides +4 dice. |

| Some runners say that old tricks are the best tricks, and they’re the ones who most love the simple but effective oil slick sprayer. Using a few nozzles and a reservoir of slick fluid, the ground immediately behind the vehicle can be made extremely hazardous to pursuing groundbased vehicles. Activating the oil slick sprayer is a Free Action; following activation, any ground vehicles in pursuit at Short Range must make a Reaction + Vehicle Skill [Handling] (2) Test to avoid crashing. The oil slick sprayer has 6 charges and can be completely refilled for 50 nuyen. |

## Ram Plate

While ramming might be a last resort for some, it is a first resort for others, and the ram plate is the perfect modification for those people. Ram plates come in a huge variety of shapes and sizes, from wickedly engineered sharpened bifurcating blades to a motley collection of extra car parts that the gangers welded to the front. All are equally effective. When making a Ramming attack (see p. 203, SR5) the damage done by the ramming vehicle is increased by one level, as if it were going one speed category higher. Damage taken to the ramming vehicle is unchanged.

For a little bit more nuyen, the system can be installed with thermal smoke. |

## Weapon Mount

Shadowrunning is not a business where one wants tobe defenseless (or offense-less, for that matter), so riggers often awant to put weapons on their vehicle. While a small number of security or military-class vehicles are designed to mount weapon systems, the vast majority of vehicles are designed and built for civilian use, so installing a weapon system is strictly an after-market affair. Just like the weapons that they support, weapon mounts come in a large variety of shapes and sizes to suit the needs of the weapon as well as the owner. All weapon mounts have four attributes: Size, Visibility, Flexibility, and Control.

**Size** defines what kind of weapons can be attached to the weapon mount. Light weapon mounts can hold weapons in the following categories: Melee, Tasers, Hold-Out Pistols Light Pistols, Heavy Pistols, Machine Pistols, and Submachine Guns. Standard weapon mounts can hold Tasers, Hold-Outs, Light Pistols, Heavy Pistols, Assault Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Shotguns, Exotic Ranged Weapons, Flamethrowers, and Special Weapons. Heavy weapon mounts can hold any of the previous, as well as weapons from the following categories: Machine Guns, Cannons, Launchers, and Lasers.

**Visibility** defines where a weapon is mounted on a vehicle and how noticeable it is. An external mount places the weapon on the outside of the vehicle, on its hull somewhere, which is plainly obvious to any observer. An internal mount has the weapon inside the vehicle until it’s deployed using a Simple Action. Once deployed the weapon is externally visible and easily seen, but while internal the weapon cannot be seen from outside observation. A concealed mount is an internal mount but further conceals the weapon behind false paneling and other vehicle features such that it is not obvious even when searching the inside, requiring a Perception + Intuition [Intuition] (4) Test to find.

**Flexibility** defines how movable a weapon is on its mount. A fixed mount cannot turn independently from the vehicle it is attached to and so relies on the driver of the vehicle to aim the weapon; it cannot change its direction of fire unless the vehicle direction also changes. A flexible mount has a limited range of motion, able to move ninety degrees horizontally and vertically. A turret mount allows for a full 360-degree of movement but can be constrained depending on where on the hull of the vehicle the weapon is placed. Most smart riggers will put a turret mount on the roof of the vehicle to fully utilize its range of motion.

**Control** determines how the weapon attached to the mount can be fired. These days the default is remote, meaning the weapon can be fired by making a Control Device Matrix Action (the owner of such a device automatically succeeds). For the security paranoid, or those that just like the hands-on approach, manual control can be applied to a weapon. This option removes the possibility of remote, electronic control in favor of direct mechanical operation of the weapon, meaning a metahuman must physically operate the weapon, which tends to put them at bodily risk. Armored manual control is an option where the operator of the weapon is protected by armored panels and shields while operating the weapon. This gives the firer +6 armor against ranged attacks while operating the weapon.

To calculate the final cost of the weapon mount modification, start with the Size. The apply the modifiers to Slot, Threshold, Availability, and Cost when choosing the other options. Use the highest requirement for Tools from the options chosen

# Body Modifications

Body modifications modify the hull or structure of the vehicle in some form.

## Assembly/Disassembly

[![Blank.png](/Shadowrun/images/d/d2/Blank.png)](/Shadowrun/index.php/File:Blank.png)

| SLOTS | THRESHOLD | TOOLS | SKILL | AVAIL | COST | SOURCE |

|  |  |
| No rigger likes to see their vehicle “baby” in pieces, but at least with the assembly/disassembly modification they know it can be put back together. For times when a rigger or their team needs to get a vehicle to (or into) a location but can’t get it there whole, they put in an assembly modification. While this can be used on larger vehicles to give more flexibility in how they can be transported, it is far more common for smaller vehicles like drones. Secure facilities will commonly search and scan for illegal or banned drones, such as small surveillance “bugs,” but detection can be circumvented by breaking the drone down into innocuous parts and smuggling those in separately. The assembly/disassembly modification allows a vehicle to be broken down into several smaller pieces and then reassembled for operation. Disassembling or reassembling a vehicle takes a (Vehicle Mechanic Skill) + Logic [Logic] (Body, 30 minutes) Extended Test. When broken down, the parts are extremely difficult to identify, requiring a Perception + Intuition [Intuition] (4) Test as well as having an appropriate Knowledge Skill to even recognize that the parts could be a vehicle component. |

## Chameleon Coating

|  |  |
| Not just for the flighty owner who can’t settle on a paint color for their vehicle, chameleon coating is an essential tool for keeping a vehicle used for shadow activities inconspicuous. A vehicle with the coating has its exterior hull covered in a specialized kind of polymer that allows it to display any kind of image sent to the system with an electronic signal. This can be as simple as changing the color of the vehicle, or as complex as covering it in moving advertisements and video. Changing the output of the coating is a Free Action. Particularly clever riggers have linked the video feed from their external sensors into the system so that the exterior of the vehicle mimics the environment around it, resulting in a crude (but effective) “cloaking” or blending system. When running in this mode, as long as it is not moving faster than its Walking rate, Perception Tests made to find the vehicle suffer a –3 dice pool penalty. |

## Ejection Seat

Remember that time when there was an annoying or, in the back and you wished you could just push a button and fire him out of the vehicle? Well, with ejection seats you can! Using a simple expanding gas propulsion system, activated remotely with a Free Action, any seat in the vehicle can become a means to eject the occupant of that seat. Seats can be equipped with parachutes if the system is being used for safe egress of someone that you want to be whole when they land, or without if not. Traditionally, ejection seats launch vertically upward, but they can be configured to launch horizontally, or even straight down (particularly vicious in aircraft or watercraft).

## Extra Entry/Exit Points

|  |  |
| There are plenty of situations when a runner may need to get in or out of their vehicle in an unusual way, for an unusual situation. A vehicle equipped with extra entry/exit points has a variety of extra points on the vehicle that can be used to get in or out of the vehicle. These could be an ork-sized sunroof, or a special trap door in the floor of the vehicle. In game terms, any occupant of the vehicle is assumed to have a convenient entry or exit point accessible to them, no matter what state the vehicle it is in (including upside down), or from what position they are attempting to access the vehicle (such as from the roof). |

|  |  |
| Most vehicles are manufactured with the anticipation and intention that they will be used in common or banal environments—basically, those found in the day-to-day life of most of the population. There are plenty of times, however, when a rigger will need his vehicle to operate smoothly in environments outside of those normal conditions. Since most vehicles were never designed to handle such conditions, several special modifications are needed on a variety of systems, depending on the environment. This could include additives and micro-heaters to ensure the vehicle’s liquid systems do not freeze in extreme cold, or super-coolers to keep it running in extreme heat. Each time this modification is taken, the vehicle can operate normally in a specific selected environment (desert, arctic, etc.). If the environment itself will be damaging to the vehicle, it needs a Special Armor Modification to maintain protection. Note that this modification only allows the vehicle itself to continue to operate; keeping occupants of the vehicle alive would be handled by a life support system (below). |

| While no riggers likes to be the “team mom” or the “runner taxi,” there are plenty of times that they will need to carry more people than their vehicle originally allowed, especially if they’re driving some super-slick European sports car that could only carry two to begin with. With increased seating, a vehicle can comfortably carry more passengers than its original design. This is far more than just jamming a couple of extra think people in the trunk—the modification includes all features for carrying people including comfortable (enough) seating, incorporating the vehicle’s safety systems (including PPS if installed, see p. 159), and other personal comfort features such as ventilation and lighting. This can mean rearranging the internal layout of the vehicle, extending it slightly, or even adding “external” seating, such as a sidecar on a motorcycle. When this modification is taken, the passenger capacity of the vehicle is increased up to a fifty percent increase of its base value, though the gamemaster has final say on exactly how many passengers the vehicle can reasonably carry. |

The world outside of a vehicle is often dangerous or outright hostile to shadowrunners and their targets. In order to keep their occupants secure, many vehicles install a Life Support system. This system comes in two levels, depending on the need. In a Level 1 system, all normal “leak points” in a vehicle—such as door and window frames—have been made air and water tight; air only circulates through the vehicle’s ventilation system. The system also includes a variety of detection systems and filters to help prevent airborne toxins and diseases from harming those inside a vehicle. All occupants of the vehicle gain +4 dice for any resistance test to an airborne drug, toxin, or disease that comes from outside the vehicle. A Level 2 system includes everything from the Level 1 system while also allowing all external air intakes to be shut off, making the vehicle completely air and water tight. Additionally, the vehicle is equipped with its own independent air supply, allowing passengers to survive where there is no air, such as under water or in space. Level 2 also counts as a Chemical Seal (p. 437, SR5) for any game situations where that applies.

Did a teammate ever ask you to give a hand? Well, with the mechanical arm modification your vehicle actually can! This modification essentially gives your vehicle an (extra) appendage, and comes in two different forms. Arms in both forms have a length roughly equal to Body x 10 centimeters, and five centimeters for a Body 0 vehicle. The arm has a Strength equal to the vehicle’s Body / 2 (rounded up). A **basic** mechanical arm is a simple system with a limited range of motion that is very useful for basic grasping and carrying operations. These are generally used to load and unload cargo from the vehicle or something near it and can be used for any operations reasonably similar to that, such as putting a drone back into a drone rack. An **articulated** mechanical arm is a mechanical reproduction of a metahuman arm mounted on a vehicle. It has fine motor abilities and can grasp and use tools. A rigger jumped into a vehicle with an articulated mechanical arm can use any of their Technical Skills with the arm, though the gamemaster can impose a penalty if the vehicle is only equipped with one and the task regularly requires two arms. Most surprisingly (for those that don’t expect it), an articulated mechanical arm can make a melee attack against any target within range. To make a melee attack, roll Melee Skill + Agility [Accuracy]—if a rigger is jumped into the vehicle, the test uses their appropriate melee skill. If the vehicle is attacking autonomously use (Autosoft) + Pilot.

|  |  |
| While many people have (understandably) gotten skittish about injecting nanites into their head, most of the population still considers it safe to have them operate on something inorganic like their vehicle. The nanomaintenance system installs a series of specialized nanobot hives around the body of the vehicle and in key sections designed to repair and maintain the vehicle’s body and systems. This includes reshaping body panels and filling holes, cleaning critical systems, and even rebuilding/reshaping parts on a small scale. Nanomaintenance systems come in Ratings 1 to 4. When repairing damage done to a vehicle, an owner can let the nanomaintenance system attempt its job autonomously, or make repairs in conjunction with the system. If repairing autonomously, roll the Rating of the nanomaintenance system. Each hit repairs one box of vehicle damage, with the whole process taking one hour. Alternatively, the owner can repair the damage with the assistance of the system. In this case, the owner makes a standard Repair Test, with the nanomaintence system giving a bonus equal to its Rating (see p. 146, SR5). Either one option or the other must be chosen for each instance of damage to be repaired—the two cannot be combined on the same damages. |

| When undertaking surreptitious surveillance, making a drone look like not a drone is an essential asset. For this reason, many riggers will wrap smaller drones, or anything up to humanoid size, in a synthetic skin material. The intricacy of the disguise can vary depending on how much time and resources are put into it. This can range from a simple coating of realistic-looking skin made from a synthetic material, to a full covering of living tissue fed by an artificial circulation system with devices to simulate organs. The realistic features mod has a Rating of 1 to 4. The Rating sets the threshold of the Perception Test to recognize the machine as artificial. When the modification is made, the installer chooses a single living being that the modification is trying to replicate. This modification is designed to be made on vehicles no bigger than the size of a large animal. The gamemaster can decide whether the modification is even possible, given the size and design of the vehicle, but nearly all drones should be able to accept the modification. The true nature of the vehicle is instantly recognizable by Assensing. |

You don’t need to run very long before you encounter a situation where you need to keep something (or someone) hidden from authorities that are trying to find it. In these situations, the smuggling compartment is what you need. This modification adds a storage compartment to the vehicle, one that is designed to not easily be found. In general, a smuggling compartment cannot be seen unless a person is specifically looking for hidden compartments or doing a thorough search of the vehicle, and even in that case the Perception Test to notice the compartment is made with a –6 penalty. Smuggling compartments are hidden by purely visual means, so if the contents of the compartment make it detectable by other means—chemical, radioactive, thermographic—these do not suffer a penalty. Compartments can have **shielding** installed on them to make the compartment difficult to detect by a particular non-visual sense. If this is done, then the –6 penalty applies to that sense as well. Shielding on a smuggling compartment may be taken multiple times, each time specifying a different sensory type (auditory, chemical, radioactive, astral, etc.). The gamemaster determines if an object can fit in a smuggling compartment, based on the size of the vehicle. In general, smuggling compartments are about ten to twenty percent of the overall size of the vehicle itself.

| If you have teammates that just can’t seem to stop from getting themselves critically injured, then they are going to thank you for installing a Valkyrie module. Named after the mythical maidens that carry a Viking warrior to the afterlife, the Valkyrie module is a small-scale, portable, automated emergency room. The module includes a bed with a transparent, enclosed lid and a host of sophisticated medical equipment with built-in software that can quickly analyze and treat almost any injury. Any person placed in the Valkyrie module is automatically stabilized (p. 209, SR5). The systems on the Valkyrie module are equivalent to a Rating 6 Medkit, with all of the same functionality. Additionally, the Valkyrie module operates as an autodoc, and so can be operated remotely. |

For those times when a runner needs to pull or tow something and they don’t want to call an underpaid and overweight member of the auto club, there is the winch modification. The **basic** winch hasn’t changed its design much in about a hundred years. It has a heavy gauge steel cable ending with a hook or latch and wraps around a powered drum. A winch can be mounted on the front or rear of the vehicle, and comes with about one hundred meters of cable and can support a load of up to ten tons, provided the vehicle itself is heavy enough to support this. If wireless enabled, the winch hook can be released remotely with a Free Action. An **enhanced** winch is generally found in heavy industrial or rescue vehicles but can be useful to a runner. Its winch replaces the hook with an advanced system using a combination of gecko-grip technology and magnetism that can attach to any surface on its target without the need to manually place a hook on an appropriate part. The system can be activated or deactivated remotely with a wireless command (if enabled). The enhanced system can support a load of up to one hundred tons and includes additional stabilizers deployed from the vehicle and onto/into the ground to double the towing vehicle’s weight for lifting purposes.

| For the true tinkerers who can never be apart from their tools, a vehicle with ample enough space can be made into a mobile workshop. Niceties and comfort items are removed to make room for shelving, work spaces, and equipment. A vehicle modified in this way counts as being a Shop for the purposes of tool availability (p. 443, SR5). The type of shop (Automotive Mechanic, Armorer) must be chosen at the time of the modification and cannot be changed. |
