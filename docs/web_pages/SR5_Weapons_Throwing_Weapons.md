Throw and Catch
:   Throwing and catching a returning boomerang requires two tests spread over two Combat Turns—a Throwing Weapons + Agility [Physical] (2) Test to throw it properly and an Agility + Reaction (4) Test to catch it on the return. A boomerang that hits a target does not return.

Range
:   Boomerangs use the ranges of Aerodynamic Grenades.

Horizon BoomerEye
:   This is a cheap surveillance tool created by some bored engineers out in the desert. The BoomerEye is a video camera attached to a boomerang that can be tossed out and get a bird’s-eye view of an area. The device can be downloaded with a Complex Action on return to the thrower.

    Wireless Bonus
    :   The device can provide live-feed video while in flight.

This is not the cute toy of your youth that you throw and try to get to come right back to you. This is the Aboriginal hunting stick that can snap the neck of an emu. Made of a wide variety of materials the modern hunting boomerang is either a heavy wood with a dull edge or a lighter composite with a sharp edge. Both are deadly in the right hands.

- The BoomerEye is a Renraku Australia product that combines a little Australian history with some Japanese innovation. A cheap, unguided surveillance tool, the BoomerEye is a lightweight sport boomerang with a special camera mounted on the bottom. It’s designed to be thrown over a wide arc and get a quick peak at what might be hidden out of sight.

Melee
:   Urban Tribe Tomahawk use the Throwing Weapons skill, but they may also be used as melee weapon, using the Blades skill and doing the same damage as the thrown weapon.

Range
:   Urban Tribe Tomahawk use the ranges of Throwing Knives.

This is not your grandfather’s tomahawk. Made from modern composites and balanced for throwing, this modern take on the classic Native American weapon gives as much respect to its predecessors as it can while moving into the 21st century. Popular among the urban tribal street gangs, especially the First Nations in Seattle, these finely crafted killing tools can also be found on the belts of Salish Rangers and Sioux Wildcats.

Melee
:   Harpoons use the Throwing Weapons skill, but they may also be used as melee weapon, using the Blades skill and doing the same damage as the thrown weapon with a Reach of 2.

Range
:   Harpoon/Javelin use the ranges of Aerodynamic Grenades.

There’s a reason why the javelin was part of the original Olympics, which was a militaristic sporting competition. Metahumans have been using sharpened sticks to kill prey, and each other, for millennia. Improvements to materials technology have just allowed them to throw further, faster, and more accurately.

Wireless
:   If all the throwing knives or shuriken you throw in a single Combat Turn are wireless and you have a smartlink system, each knife you throw receives a +1 dice pool bonus per knife thrown that Combat Turn at your current target, as the knives inform and adjust for wind and other atmospheric conditions. So you’d get no bonus on the first throw, a +1 bonus on the second throw, a +2 bonus on the third throw, etc. (assuming you aimed all three knives at the same target).

A wide variety of shapes and sizes of aerodynamically balanced, specially weighted, muscle-powered throwing weapons are available, from throwing spikes to darts to kunai and shuriken. A character can ready (Agility ÷ 2) of these knives with one Ready Weapon action.
