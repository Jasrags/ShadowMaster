## Camouflage

The sprite can conceal a file within another file in such a way as to make it invisible to Matrix searches. Concealed files can only be found with a Matrix Perception Test that is specifically looking for the hidden file; even the sprite must make this test in order to find and extract the file.

## Cookie

A sprite uses its cookie power to "tag" a target persona with a cookie file that can be used to track the icon's Matrix activities. The sprite must successfully beat the target in a Hacking + Resonance [Sleaze] v. Intuition + Firewall test. If the sprite succeeds, the persona starts carrying the cookie file, none the wiser. The cookie file runs silent and is protected with a rating equal to the sprite's Level. The file will log every everything the icon does, for example each host the persona enters, the details of any communications the persona engages in (with whom and when, but not the actual contents), any programs the icon uses, etc. Use the net hits to benchmark the depth of the data the cookie accumulates (1 hit providing a bare outline, 4 or more a detailed report). At the end of a time determined by the sprite (or its owner) when placed, the cookie file transfers itself and its accumulated data to the sprite. Once the sprite has it, it may turn it over to the technomancer. If the sprite isn't in the Matrix when the file transfers itself, the file is deleted. Cookie files may be detected with a successful Matrix Perception Test performed on the carrying persona. Once identified, it may be removed by removing the
file's protection and then deleting it.

## Diagnostics

The Diagnostics power allows the sprite to evaluate the inner workings of an electronic device. The sprite can assist someone using or repairing the device with a Teamwork Test. The sprite makes a Simple Hardware + Level [Data Processing] test; if any hits are rolled, the character gets a +1 limit bonus, and each hit adds 1 die to the character's dice pool to use or repair the item. This power takes the sprite's entire attention; the bonus lasts until the sprite drops it or does something else.

## Electron Storm

This attack allows the sprite to engulf a target persona in a sustained barrage of corrupting datastreams. If the sprite beats the target in a Cybercombat + Resonance [Attack] v. Intuition + Firewall test, the target is swallowed in a hail of digital pulses. With the first successful attack and on each subsequent action the sprite performs while sustaining this power, it inflicts (Resonance) DV Matrix damage, resisted as normal. The engulfing storm also causes 2 points of noise to the target. If the sprite takes any Matrix damage, all of its electron storms end immediately.

## Gremlins

This power causes a device to mysteriously malfunction or operate in some (usually detrimental) manner. The sprite targets a device, making a Hardware + Level [Attack] v. Device Rating + Firewall test. If the sprite succeeds, the device suffers a glitch (p. 45). The gamemaster chooses a malfunction appropriate to the device and situation, like a jammed control, a looped signal, or a faulty reading. If the sprite scores 4 or more net hits, treat it as a critical glitch— the device crashes, burns out, jolts its user with an electrical shock, or some other goodie picked by the gamemaster.

## Hash

The Hash power allows the sprite to temporarily protect a file with a unique Resonance algorithm in such a way that only the sprite can unprotect it. If the sprite stops carrying the hashed file it reverts to normal. If the sprite is destroyed while carrying the file, the hashed file is permanently corrupted and becomes worthless. The maximum time the sprite can use this power is Level x 10 Combat Turns.

## Stability

A sprite can use this power on any persona or device for which it has a mark. Stability prevents normal malfunctions or accidents from afflicting the target (including both standard glitches and those induced by the Gremlins or Accident powers). Ignore standard glitches and reduce critical glitches to standard glitches.

## Suppression

Sprites are confusing at the best of times, but a sprite using suppression is just bizarre, especially to hosts. If a sprite is in a host and using this power when the host launches IC, that IC is delayed from launching by (Level / 2) Combat Turns. Delayed IC can't act or be targeted.

## Watermark

The sprite can tag an icon with an invisible marking that only Resonance-driven entities can see, kind of like a Matrix signature. This allows the sprite to secretly leave messages on Matrix objects. A sprite can overwrite an existing watermark with a new one. A watermark can be erased with the Erase Matrix Signature action; otherwise it lasts as long as the icon does.
