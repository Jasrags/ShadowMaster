# Shadowrun Fifth Edition Character Creation

## Recommended Order for Character Creation

The following order is recommended for creating a Shadowrun 5th Edition character (p. 65):

1. **Select "Magic or Resonance" Priority**
   - Record your new Magic or Resonance starting value, if any
2. **Select Positive and Negative Qualities**
   - These may change your maximum Attribute and Skill levels
3. **Select Metatype Priority**
   - Spend Special Attribute Points
4. **Select Attributes Priority**
   - Spend Attribute Points
5. **Select Skill Priority**
   - Spend free Knowledge and Language skill points (based on Intuition + Logic)
   - Spend "skill group points"
   - Spend "skill points"
6. **Select Resources Priority**
   - Spend Nuyen
   - Select Lifestyle
7. **Spend Leftover Karma**
   - Spend Free "Contacts Karma" (based on Charisma)
   - Improve skills, attributes, etc.
   - Make sure you have ≤7 Karma when you're done

## Step One: Tips for Character Creation

A spreadsheet, word processing document, or pen and paper will help keep things organized as you go through the character creation process. Organization makes it easier to track your chosen priorities, Karma expenditures, Essence, and other elements. As you work, note any bonuses you receive from Qualities or augmentations on the character sheet, because these may modify your statistics by the end of character creation.

Character creation involves many decisions, from choosing the right skills to purchasing the appropriate gear. It can take as little as an hour or as long as an evening. Having an idea of what you want to play before you sit down helps the process run smoothly.

### Choose Concept

The sidebar "Common Character Concepts and Their Roles Explained" provides a snapshot of character types you are likely to find in the shadows. Disparate characters band together as runner teams, blending their talents and expertise to complete missions they could not accomplish alone. Some runner teams form for a single job, while others stay together throughout their careers, becoming as close-knit as family. The gallery is only a starting point—many characters do not conform to any list. The one you create will be uniquely yours.

Consider some core background concepts. Your character could be an ex-soldier applying her combat skills on the streets, a former corporate headhunter forced out by a rival and now leveraging negotiation talent to survive the shadows, a second-generation runner who learned the trade from SINless parents, a bounty hunter supplementing income through shadowrunning, a gang member seeking a better life, or someone fresh out of jail eager to use the skills and connections gained inside.

You do not need to understand every nuance of character creation to get started. Begin with a concept and dive in—your character will quickly become unique.

Players and the gamemaster should collaborate to develop a team of characters suited to the campaign. The rules in this document create an experienced shadowrunner. For alternate creation levels (street level, prime runner), see the Alternate Gameplay section below.

Every character (excluding Street-Level and Prime Runner games) starts with **25 Karma** to improve themselves and gain additional resources during the process.

### Common Character Types and Their Roles

**Face**: The face runs his fingers over the thrumming strings of other people's wants and needs, playing them like a maestro. He is master of the con, a polished negotiator, and often an expert leader. Interacting with Mr. Johnson during the meet is his specialty, especially when it comes to bargaining for the greatest profit. The face also excels at legwork, coaxing or squeezing vital information from a variety of sources that could help make sure his job is a success. Though the face usually manages to get what he wants with charm and a smile, he knows how to be more forceful to get people to cough up their secrets. Words are the face's weapon of choice and Charisma and Willpower are the face's two important attributes—but he has no problem using an Ares Predator when the situation warrants.

**Spellcaster**: A manabolt to your chest, a fireball in your face—that's what the spellcaster brings to the table in combat. And he does so much more. He manipulates and channels mana, an energy field that is the essence of magic. Mana can be manipulated in several different ways, allowing for different types of spellcasters. Magicians follow a more logical and ordered system of magic, while shamans rely more on their instincts and intuition. To make a spellcaster, a player needs to select a priority that grants a Magic attribute rating (see Priority Table). Depending on the tradition, Charisma or Intuition can be important attributes for spellcasters, and Willpower is an important attribute for resisting Drain.

**Decker**: The trickster in the Matrix, the flash of lightning in the corner of your virtual eye—a decker specializes in hacking into computers, commlinks, and datahavens. Her job often involves stealing, altering, and manipulating data as well as taking control of or modifying security systems so her teammates can get in and out of defended facilities. A good decker knows her work may put her right in the middle of heated action, and she knows how to react. Whether she's firing a weapon, disabling the weapons of others, or sending every electronic device in a place on the attack, she has a whole bunch of options to keep herself involved in unfolding combat. A decker never travels without her cyberdeck, the tool of her trade. Logic, Intuition, and Willpower can be important attributes for the decker character.

**Technomancer**: Some people hack the Matrix with physical tools, but a few have the ability to log on with nothing more than their minds. These people are technomancers. A technomancer can access the Matrix with his mind through an intrinsic connection that's not fully understood, even in 2075—though plenty of people would pay plenty to figure out how it works. A player who wishes to play a technomancer must select an option on the Priority Table that gives the character a Resonance attribute. Logic, Intuition, and Willpower can be important attributes for the technomancer.

**Rigger**: Some people drive cars; other people use vehicles as an extension of their body, like an additional set of limbs. A rigger is a professional driver, an ace controller of all sorts of machines. She is highly skilled in the operation, repair, and customization of all sorts of vehicles and/or drones, offering surveillance, transportation, and remote firepower to their team. Reaction is a critical attribute for riggers.

**Street Samurai**: Some artists work in watercolors, some in oils. The street samurai is an artist of pain. In any given situation, he knows fifteen ways to hurt an opponent, and an additional eight ways to hurt an opponent real bad. He can take significant amounts of damage and stay standing, leveling devastating damage on her opponents. He typically is augmented with significant amounts of cyberware and bioware to make him exceptionally tough and dangerous in physical and armed combat. While he is ferocious and deadly, he tends to have a code—it may be a code comprehensible only to him, but it's something. Body, Strength, and Agility are important attributes for characters that are street samurai.

### Implementation Notes

- Provide an introductory wizard screen that captures player and character concept notes.
- Surface quick reminders about total Karma pool, tracking aids, and recommended prep steps.
- Allow free-form notes that persist through the wizard for later reference.

### Alternate Gameplay

Shadowrun provides players with two alternate ways of building characters besides the normal experienced players. The first is for street-level characters; characters that have not yet had a chance to establish themselves as runners and are still in the process of earning their street cred. Obviously, these characters will not have the same gear or resources as the experienced shadowrunner. The second option is the prime runner build to create a character who has successfully been running the shadows long enough to have established their reputations as professionals in the eyes of Mr. Johnson. They possess the gear, the connections, and the talent to back up those reputations. The following are the rules for each level of alternate game play:

#### Street-Level Play

- Modify the resources column on the Priority Table as follows:
  - Priority A: 75,000 nuyen
  - Priority B: 50,000 nuyen
  - Priority C: 25,000 nuyen
  - Priority D: 15,000 nuyen
  - Priority E: 6,000 nuyen
- Karma: Each player receives 13 Karma to customize characters (maximum of 26 Karma).
- Gear Restrictions: Device Ratings must be rated at 4 or less. Maximum Availability is limited to 10 or less.
- Nuyen Restrictions: Characters may only convert up to 5 Karma into nuyen (10,000 nuyen).
- Follow all other rules for Character Creation/Advancement as laid out in this chapter.

#### Prime Runner Play

- Modify the resources column on the Priority Table as follows:
  - Priority A: 500,000 nuyen
  - Priority B: 325,000 nuyen
  - Priority C: 210,000 nuyen
  - Priority D: 150,000 nuyen
  - Priority E: 100,000 nuyen
- Karma: Each player receives 35 Karma to customize characters (maximum of 70 Karma).
- Gear Restrictions: Device Ratings must be rated at 6 or less. Maximum Availability is 15 or less.
- Nuyen Restrictions: Characters may convert up to 25 Karma into nuyen (50,000 nuyen).
- Karma Restrictions: Instead of the normal Charisma x 3 Karma for contacts, increase this amount to Charisma x 6 Karma for contacts.
- Follow all other rules for Character Creation/Advancement as laid out in this chapter.

### Karma Build Method (Optional)

There is an optional ruleset for building characters as described in SR5:RF, page 64. The process is as follows:

1. Beginning with 800 karma, purchase a Metatype (see Metatype List for karma costs).
2. Optionally buy a quality to be able to use Magic or Resonance:
   - Adept (20 karma)
   - Aspected Magician (15 karma)
   - Magician (30 karma)
   - Mystic Adept (35 karma)
   - Technomancer (15 karma)
3. Follow the normal steps of character creation, except buying the relevant pieces with karma and exchanging 1 karma for 2,000 nuyen as needed to purchase gear.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- None currently. See [SR5 Questions & Gaps](./questions-and-gaps.md) for future updates.

## Step Two: Choose Metatype

### Metatype & Special Attributes

Shadowrun Fifth Edition uses the Priority System, a table with columns for Metatype, Attributes, Magic or Resonance, Skills, and Resources. Rows cover Priority Levels A through E. Players assign a distinct priority level to each column—no duplicates allowed. Higher priorities grant greater benefits. Karma can later customize attributes further.

Character creation begins by selecting a metatype (human, elf, dwarf, ork, troll). Each metatype provides different advantages and disadvantages. Humans gain +1 Edge. Trolls receive thermographic vision, +1 Reach, dermal armor, and doubled lifestyle costs, reflecting the expense of adapting gear to their massive frames. Many metatypes adjust natural attribute limits as well. Consult the [Metatype Attribute Table](./data-tables.md#metatype-attribute-table) for details.

Once the player has selected the metatype they wish to play, they should review the Metatype column to determine which Priority Levels give them the best options for their character based on their preferred metatype and the special attribute points they need. The special attributes are Edge, Magic, and Resonance; if you want your character to have a high rating in one or more of these areas, make sure you select a row with plenty of special attribute points. Technomancer characters need to ensure they can have a high Resonance, while magician or adept characters will want a high Magic rating.

**Metatype Priority and Special Attribute Points:**

- The number in parentheses of your metatype is the number of Special Attribute Points you receive.
- Special Attributes are Edge, Magic and Resonance.
- Special Attribute Points can be used to increase Special Attributes at a one-for-one ratio.
- Magic and Resonance start at 0 by default.
  - Selecting a Magic or Resonance Priority besides "E" will change your starting Magic or Resonance value.
- Edge starts at 1 (2 if you're human) by default.
- Special Attributes are generally capped to 6 for all metatypes at start of play.
  - Humans can have an Edge of 7
  - Certain qualities can bring you further (Lucky, Exceptional Attribute) which require GM approval.
- Note that since you cannot be both a Technomancer and a Magician, there is no reason to ever have a positive number for both Magic and Resonance.

Special attribute points may be allocated to Edge, Magic, or Resonance. They cannot improve physical or mental attributes. Unspent special attribute points disappear at the end of creation. If a priority selection grants zero special attribute points, players may spend Karma later to raise these attributes using the Character Advancement rules (p. 103).

Most metatypes cap Magic, Resonance, and Edge at 6; humans can have Edge 7. Qualities like Lucky or Exceptional Attribute allow ratings one point above the usual limit but require Karma and gamemaster approval. Purchasing such a quality does not grant the increase automatically—the character must still spend attribute points or Karma to raise the rating. With Exceptional Attribute, a character can start with Magic or Resonance 7 before initiation or submersion.

### Mental and Physical Attributes

Next, allocate physical and mental attribute points. Choose a priority level in the Attribute column that matches your vision for the character. The number in that column is the pool of points available to raise Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength, Charisma, Intuition, Logic, and Willpower.

**Attributes Priority Rules:**

- You are given between 12 and 24 "attribute points" (not to be confused with karma) depending on priority level.
- Each attribute point raises a Physical or Mental attribute by one point.
  - Eligible attributes are:
    - [Physical] Body, Agility, Reaction, Strength
    - [Mental] Willpower, Logic, Intuition and Charisma
  - Note that special attributes (Edge, Magic, Resonance) CANNOT be raised with attribute points (they require "special attribute points" that are granted in the Metatype Priority step).
  - Initiative can never be directly raised (it is a derived attribute). Your Initiative is Intuition + Reaction + 1d6.
    - Astral Initiative is (Intuition × 2) + 2D6
    - Matrix Initiative (Cold Sim) is (Data Processing + Intuition) + 3d6
    - Matrix Initiative (Hot Sim) is (Data Processing + Intuition) + 4d6
- All attribute points must be spent in character creation.
- Only one Mental or Physical attribute can be at the racial maximum.
  - This limitation does not apply to Edge, Magic or Resonance (special attributes).

Refer to the Metatype Attribute Table while spending points. It lists starting ratings (before the slash) and maximums for each metatype. Characters begin at their metatype's base ratings at no cost—human Body 1, dwarf Body 3, ork Body 4, troll Body 5, and so on. It costs one attribute point to increase a rating by 1.

All attribute points must be spent during character creation. You cannot use these points to raise special attributes, nor can they be saved for later. Characters may have only one physical or mental attribute at their natural maximum during creation (special attributes are exempt). Some metatypes have natural limits below 6; plan accordingly.

Attribute choices affect derived stats calculated later, such as Initiative and Inherent Limits. Initiative is Intuition + Reaction (see p. 52). Inherent Limits restrict the number of hits counted in certain tests (p. 46). Technomancers should note that mental attributes determine their Living Persona in the Matrix (p. 249), and magicians use mental attributes for astral projections (p. 314).

### Implementation Notes

- UI must support assigning unique priorities to five categories and reflect SR5-specific values.
- Build metatype selection cards that enforce availability based on chosen priority and display racial traits/maximums.
- **Special Attribute Allocation (Implemented)**:
  - Special attribute points are allocated in Step 3 (Metatype & Attributes) after regular attribute allocation.
  - The step order has been optimized: Step 2 is Magic/Resonance (select magic type), Step 3 is Metatype & Attributes (allocate attributes and special attributes).
  - This order ensures the magic type is already selected when allocating special attributes, so Magic/Resonance fields are immediately available.
  - The `SpecialAttributeAllocator` component displays Edge (always available), Magic (for magical types), and Resonance (for technomancers).
  - Magic and Resonance fields appear dynamically based on the selected magic type from Step 2:
    - Magic appears for: Magician, Adept, Aspected Magician, Mystic Adept
    - Resonance appears for: Technomancer
  - The component validates that all special attribute points are allocated before proceeding to the next step.
  - Edge starts at 1 (2 for humans) and can be raised to 6 (7 for humans).
  - Magic and Resonance start at 0 and can be raised to 6.
  - Unspent special attribute points are lost at the end of character creation.
- Attribute distribution page must preload metatype starting ratings, enforce "one attribute at natural max" rule, and track remaining points in real time.
- Persist modifier effects (e.g., troll lifestyle cost multiplier) for later steps.

### Priority Table

The Priority System uses a table with the following columns: Metatype, Attributes, Magic or Resonance, Skills, and Resources. The rows are divided into Priority Levels ranging from Priority A to Priority E. Players assign a specific Priority Level for each of the columns to their character depending on their preferences. The values assigned must be different for each column (representing each aspect of the character), and there can be no duplications. For example, a character may not have Priority Level B for Magic or Resonance and Priority B for Resources. The higher the Priority Level (A, B, etc.), the more valuable it is for the character.

**Priority Table**

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

## Step Three: Choose Magic or Resonance

The Magic/Resonance column governs magical characters (adepts, aspected magicians, full magicians, mystic adepts) and technomancers. Players uninterested in these roles assign priority E here. Review the Magic User Types section below, along with "Life as a Magic User in 2075" and "Life as a Technomancer in 2075," for expectations.

**Magic or Resonance Priority Rules:**

- The priority table (p. 65) shows you what your starting Resonance or Magic special attribute level is. Your Special Attribute score should be immediately changed to reflect this, and this should be done before adding Special Attribute Points (see Metatype Priority).
- Aspected Magicians can never change back to regular Magicians.
- You may also get Magical Skills if you select priority "A" or "B".
  - Magical Skills are listed on page 90.
    - Alchemy, Artificing, Banishing, Binding, Counterspelling, Disenchanting, Ritual Spellcasting, Spellcasting, Summoning

Priorities A through C specify starting Magic or Resonance ratings and bundled skills, spells, or complex forms. These bundles are prepaid and do not cost skill points or Karma, though ratings can increase later. Consult the Skills chapter (p. 128) for active skill descriptions and the list of magic and Resonance skills. Adepts should ensure their chosen skills support desired powers (p. 308). Spell lists begin on p. 283; complex forms on p. 252.

Aspected magicians must select a specific magic skill group (Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting). Once chosen, they can never acquire skills from the other magical groups, at creation or later.

Adepts gain Power Points equal to Magic for free. Mystic adepts must purchase Power Points with Karma (5 Karma per point) up to their Magic rating. These points are typically purchased during Step Seven.

Players are not restricted to the bundles provided by their priority choice. Additional spells, complex forms, registered sprites, or bound spirits can be purchased with Karma near the end of character creation.

### Life for a Magic User in 2075

Magic has been back in the world for more than sixty years, but the Awakened—the term for those who channel magic—remain a small minority of the population. As a result, they are both admired and feared. They are the subjects of wild rumors, baseless speculation, and the occasional freefloating prejudice.

Many mundane metahumans fear what the Awakened can do with their abilities. There have been magic-based terror attacks, ranging from the Ghost Dance to the global attacks Winternight launched before and during the second Matrix Crash in 2064, that give credence to these fears. Policlubs like Humanis feed these fears, building them up to spark hate and violence against the Awakened.

As a reflection of this fear and as a measure of caution, many sprawls require magic users to register their gear, spell formulas, and spirits (typically they only care about spirits and gear of at least moderate power—in game terms, those with a rating of 3 or higher). They are required to purchase licenses in order to legitimately carry and use magic. These legal licenses often come with invasive requirements, including being subjected to compliance checks that can be conducted at any time, giving law-enforcement corporations the right to search a magic user's premises without a warrant, even when the person is not present. Some sprawls require magic users to give law enforcement agencies and/or security corporations blood samples that could serve as material links to track the character magically if necessary. Because of this, many magic users in the shadows have fake IDs and licenses, partly so they won't get nabbed by the cops, but also so they don't have to turn any part of their bodies over to them. Rules and cost for magic items and licenses are found in the Street Gear section. Since magic is such a rare commodity, it is very much desired by the megacorporations. Legally registered magic users often find themselves the targets of extractions, snatched by rival megacorporations looking to press them into employment.

The Awakened have their own prejudices, often against magic users not of their type (e.g., magicians are sometimes prejudiced against adepts). Since they are limited in what they can do, aspected magicians suffer the most prejudice within the Awakened community. Many see them as not fully Awakened or not full magic users, and they are barred from many magic groups.

### Magic User Types

Shadowrun has four distinct types of magic users: Adept, Magician, Aspected Magician, and Mystic Adept. Here's a quick breakdown of the unique characteristics of each group:

#### Adepts

- Adepts channel mana into their own bodies to enhance their natural abilities, making their talents and skills much more potent.
- Adepts never astrally project.
- Adepts only perceive astral space by purchasing the Astral Perception power.
- Adepts can learn the Assensing skill only if they have the Astral Perception power.
- Adepts cannot use skills from any magic-related skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting).
- Adepts can follow mentor spirits.
- Adepts gain Adept Powers that are purchased with Power Points. Adepts receive a number of Power Points equal to their Magic rating.

#### Magicians

- Magicians can astrally perceive.
- Magicians can astrally project.
- Magicians can choose freely from the magical skills or skill groups (Sorcery, Conjuring, Enchanting).
- Magicians can cast spells, conjure spirits, or enchant magical items.
- At character creation, magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).

#### Aspected Magicians

- Aspected magicians are a limited form of magician.
- Aspected magicians do not astrally project.
- Aspected magicians can astrally perceive.
- Aspected magicians must choose one, and only one, of the following three Skills/Skill Groups:
  - Sorcery (Spellcasting and related skills)
  - Conjuring (Summoning and related skills)
  - Enchanting (Alchemy and related skills)
- Aspected magicians cannot perform any of the magical skills associated with the two groups they did not select.
- Aspected magicians can only learn Counterspelling if they take the skills to be a spellcaster.
- Aspected magicians can follow mentor spirits.
- At character creation, aspected magicians who cast spells, perform rituals, or create alchemical preparations may know a maximum number of formulae from each group equal to their Magic Rating x 2 (i.e., Magic Rating of 4 allows 8 spells, 8 rituals, 8 alchemical preparations).

#### Mystic Adepts

- Mystic adepts are a combination of magicians and adepts.
- Mystic adepts never astrally project.
- Mystic adepts can astrally perceive if they purchase the Astral Perception adept power.
- Mystic adepts purchase their spells/rituals/preparations in the same way as magicians.
- Mystic adepts must purchase their Power Points with Karma (5 Karma each at character creation for a full Power Point, with a maximum number of points equal to their Magic attribute rating).
- Mystic adepts can have any skills from the Enchanting, Sorcery, or Conjuring skill groups.

### Life for a Technomancer in 2075

Much about what technomancers are and how they operate is shrouded in mystery. Though there is no firm estimate of their exact number (since many of them choose to remain underground and not reveal their gift), it is believed that there are fewer technomancers than magic users.

Because so little is known about technomancers, many in the world fear what they might be and what they might be capable of. In pop culture their abilities are exaggerated to extreme proportions (they might be shown, for example, shutting down every piece of electronics for blocks), and some groups have put bounties on their heads. Many corporations would like to study technomancers, conducting experiments to map their talents and discover ways to better understand and perhaps duplicate their abilities. Others groups just want them dead. The legal rights of technomancers are hazy and ambiguous—many times deliberately so. The world in 2075 is generally hostile and occasionally very dangerous for technomancers. Many technomancers pass themselves off as ordinary deckers, carrying dummy cyberdecks to blend in. They will often do whatever it takes to keep their secret from being discovered.

### Implementation Notes

- Provide a step that unlocks options based on Magic/Resonance priority (Full Magician, Aspected, Adept, Mystic Adept, Technomancer, Mundane).
- Display starting Magic/Resonance ratings, bundled skill/spell allowances, and any automatic resources (spell points, Power Points).
- Enforce tradition/aspect selection rules (e.g., aspected magicians limited to one skill group, mystic adept Power Point purchases).
- Support Karma-based add-ons (extra spells, spirits, complex forms) and queue them for Step Seven costs.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Three questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-three-choose-magic-or-resonance).

## Step Four: Purchase Qualities

Qualities round out your character's personality and provide bonuses or penalties. Positive Qualities grant benefits at the cost of Karma; Negative Qualities impose drawbacks but reward Karma.

**Purchasing Qualities:**

- Qualities must be purchased with Karma (you start with 25 as mentioned in the beginning).
- Negative Qualities give you karma.
- You are capped to at most 25 karma worth of Positive Qualities and 25 karma worth of Negative Qualities.

Characters begin with 25 Karma. They may spend any portion on Qualities while respecting the limits of no more than 25 Karma worth of Positive Qualities and 25 Karma worth of Negative Qualities. Qualities acquired later follow Character Advancement rules (p. 103). Negative Qualities can be awarded by the gamemaster or bought off with Karma.

Record each Quality on the character sheet, noting any modifiers to skills or attributes.

### Implementation Notes

- Build a catalogue UI for browsing, filtering, and selecting Positive/Negative Qualities with costs and mechanical effects.
- Track Karma spent/refunded and enforce ±25 Karma caps during creation.
- Store quality-driven modifiers for later calculations (attribute adjustments, dice pool bonuses, restrictions).

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Four questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-four-purchase-qualities).

## Step Five: Purchase Skills

With attributes assigned, choose skills using the Skills priority column. At this point only two priorities remain, so select one for Skills.

**Skill Priority/Purchasing Skills:**

- Skills are classified as either Active, Knowledge or Language.
- Your Skill Priority Level gives you a certain number of points (ranges from 18 to 46 "**skill points**", 0 to 10 "**skill group points**").
- You are given free "Knowledge and Language" skill points equal to (Intuition + Logic) × 2
  - They can only be used for Language and Knowledge skills.
  - Language Skills are tested with (Language Skill) + (Intuition)
    - In character generation, the language skill level cannot exceed 6
  - You start with one native language as well (indicated by a "N" on the character sheet).
  - Knowledge Skills when first selected must be either Academic, Interests, Professional or Street depending on how your character learned it.
    - Academic and Professional skills are tested with (Knowledge skill) + (Logic)
    - Interests and Street Knowledge skills are tested with (Knowledge skill) + (Intuition)
- All Skills start at 0.
- Increasing a Skill costs 1 "**skill point**" per level.
- Increasing a Skill Group costs 1 "**skill group point**".
  - A skill group increases all skills in the group by 1 level.
    - Skill groups are listed on page 90 (e.g. Athletics, Electronics, Sorcery).
  - In this step you cannot separate skill levels from the skill group level (if any). That must be done in the "Spending Leftover Karma" step.
- You may also purchase Specializations with your "**skill points**".
  - Specializations cost 1 "**skill point**".
  - Specializations give you +2 dice pool when applicable.
  - Specializations can never apply to a skill group, and once purchased they "break up" the skill group preventing them from ever being raised together as a skill group again.
  - In this step you cannot specialize a Skill Group, as it would break it up. that must be done in the "Spending Leftover Karma" step.
- In character generation, skills are capped to level 6 (7 with the Aptitude quality).
  - Once play begins, skills are capped to level 12 (13 with Aptitude).
- Magic and Resonance skills cannot be purchased unless you have the associated Special Attribute.
- Aspected Magicians can only use one category of Magic Skills (Sorcery, Conjuring or Enchanting).

Skills fall into three categories:

- **Active Skills**: Offensive, defensive, and task-oriented abilities (firearms, driving, conning, spellcasting, registering sprites, etc.).
- **Knowledge Skills**: Information the character knows (hangouts, city layout, street clinics, corp politics, etc.).
- **Language Skills**: Languages the character can read, write, and speak.

### What the Numbers Mean

The first number in the Skills column is the pool of points available for individual skills, usually spent on Active skills but also usable for Knowledge and Language skills when needed. Spending one skill point either buys a new skill at rating 1 or increases an existing skill by 1.

The second number in the column is for skill groups. Groups bundle related skills that advance together. Purchasing a group grants all skills in the group at the same rating. Group points cannot buy individual skills, and individual skill points cannot raise group ratings. Skill groups cannot be broken during this step; you must wait until Step Seven to split them.

During character generation, no skill can exceed rating 6 (rating 7 requires the Aptitude quality). After creation, the maximum is 12 (13 with Aptitude). Spend every skill and group point before finishing this step.

Avoid duplicating purchases: if you buy the Athletics skill group, it already includes Running, so you do not need to buy Running separately.

Specializations represent focused expertise within a skill. Purchasing a specialization costs 1 skill point and grants +2 dice to tests involving that specialty. At character creation, a skill can have only one specialization. Additional specializations can be added later with Karma. Specializations cannot be applied to skill groups; adding one to a group skill immediately breaks the group, forcing future advancements to be purchased individually.

Strong characters balance marquee skills with supporting abilities. Shooters may also take Perception, Sneaking, and First Aid. Magicians often add Gymnastics or Palming. Faces benefit from backup combat skills. Build a versatile spread—you can raise secondary skills later with earned Karma.

Survival on the streets depends on two things (at least): being really good at what you do, and having some backup skills for when things go to hell. If you're going to be a shooter, stock up on the appropriate gun skills, but maybe add some Perception so you can see your targets coming, some Sneaking to keep them from seeing you, and some First Aid in case you wind up catching a bullet. If you're a magician, you need plenty of Spellcasting, Counterspelling, and maybe Summoning, but Gymnastics might be a nice addition to help you avoid incoming attacks, and Palming may be useful for slipping a keycard from a guard while you're invisible. And if you're a face, you need plenty of social skills, but you'll be asking for trouble if you don't buy some combat skills to fall back on for those times when words fail you. Whatever your character concept, you should think of your character's skills as a whole, building some excellent skills while also providing an overall balance to maximize your chances of success. You won't have all your skills where you want them at first, but that's why you play the game—as you finish missions and earn more Karma, you'll have the chance to boost both your skills and your attributes.

### Restricted Skills

Some skills are restricted to characters with specific attributes. Magic and Resonance-based skills require corresponding Magic or Resonance ratings. Aspected magicians are limited to one category of magical skills, while full magicians and mystic adepts can take the entire range. Deckers cannot learn Resonance-based skills (Compiling, Decompiling, Registering). Consult the Skills chapter (p. 128) for detailed restrictions.

### Implementation Notes

- Implement a skill allocation UI that tracks individual and group point pools, prevents duplicate purchases, and enforces rating caps.
- Calculate skill costs dynamically based on linked attributes (1 point if ≤ attribute, 2 points if > attribute) and reflect projections for Karma upgrades.
- Support adding, editing, and removing specializations with automatic +2 dice tracking and group-breaking rules.
- Enforce restricted skill availability by checking Magic/Resonance status and aspected limitations.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Five questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-five-purchase-skills).

## Knowledge and Language Skills

Characters receive free Knowledge and Language skill points equal to (Intuition + Logic) × 2, spent like other skill points (1 point per rating). Each character also gains one native language at rating 6 for free (marked with “N”). The Bilingual quality grants a second native language.

Purchased language skills have numeric ratings that represent fluency. A rating of 1 indicates basic comprehension, while higher ratings reflect greater mastery. No Knowledge or Language skill may exceed rating 6 at creation. Language skills use Intuition as their linked attribute.

**Common Knowledge Skills in 2075**: Chemistry, Organized Crime, Magic Groups [City] Knowledge, Dragons, Street Gang Identification, Parazoology, Corporate Politics, Vices, National Politics, Wilderness Survival, Magical Theory, Magic Threats

**Uncommon Knowledge Skills**: Black Market Pipelines, Smugglers, Runner Hangouts, Mr. Johnsons, Corporate Security, Fixers, Riggers

**Common Languages in 2075**: Spanish, Lakota, Dakota, Diné (Navajo), Russian, French, Italian, German, Aztlaner Spanish

**Uncommon Languages**: Sperethiel (elven language), Or'zet (ork language), English, Japanese, Mandarin

Knowledge skills fall into four categories:

- **Academic**: Information gained through formal education, whether from a school, tutor, university, or other structured program. Academic knowledge skills use Logic as their linked attribute.
- **Interests**: Hobbies, experiences, and personal interests of the individual character. Interest knowledge skills use Intuition as their linked attribute.
- **Professional**: Knowledge comes from an employer or professional organization. Professional knowledge skills use Logic as their linked attribute.
- **Street**: Everything a runner has picked up from life in the shadows, from drug prices to gang politics to who pays the most for stolen goods. Street knowledge skills use Intuition as their linked attribute.

Determine whether each Knowledge skill uses Intuition or Logic based on its category. Some skills may straddle categories—choose the most appropriate one for your character concept. For example, a Corporations Knowledge skill could fit in Professional, Academic, or Street categories; a neo-anarchist with this skill would likely be focused on how corporate activities affect life on the street, so for this character it would be a Street skill.

### Implementation Notes

- Auto-calculate free Knowledge/Language point pool from current Intuition and Logic values.
- Provide category tagging for Knowledge skills and enforce maximum rating 6.
- Support native language selection with automatic rating assignment and optional second native language via Bilingual quality.
- Integrate Knowledge/Language spending into the main skill UI while keeping pools separate from Active skill points.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

## Step Six: Spend Your Resources

Assign the remaining priority to Resources. This governs starting nuyen for gear and lifestyle.

**Spending your Nuyen (p. 94):**

- Your Resources Priority level will give you between 6,000 and 450,000 starting nuyen.
- You cannot end character generation with more than 5,000 nuyen.
- Karma can be converted to nuyen at 1 karma point = 2,000 nuyen
  - This is capped to 20,000 extra nuyen
- Nuyen cannot be converted to karma.
- Note that some metatypes have cost modifiers.
  - Trolls have a 10% Lifestyle cost increase
  - Dwarves have a 20% Lifestyle cost increase
  - (note that the Errata removed the extra cost for gear and increased the Lifestyle costs)
- For character generation, there are some limitations on gear:
  - Each attribute (Mental and Physical) cannot have an augmentation bonus of greater than +4 (from cyberware and bioware)
  - Availability <= 12 (note that this ignores Restricted/Forbidden, Gamemasters may choose to disallow Forbidden at character creation)
  - Device Rating <= 6
- Essence is lost whenever installing cyberware and bioware.
  - Essence starts at 6.0
  - Whenever Essence is lost, it reduces Magic and Resonance.
    - Losing .01 - 1.0 Essence reduces Magic and Resonance by 1.
    - Losing 1.01 - 2.0 Essence reduces Magic and Resonance by 2
    - etc.
  - If your Magic and Resonance reaches 0, you can become permanently burned out.

Spend most of your starting nuyen before game play. Up to 5,000¥ may be carried over; any remaining balance is lost. Karma cannot be converted to nuyen, but you may convert up to 10 Karma into 20,000¥ (2,000¥ per Karma) to supplement purchases.

Essential gear often includes a commlink, a fake SIN, and appropriate licenses.

**Gear Checklist**

What essential gear should a character consider buying?

- Weapons (Melee, Ranged, both)
- Ammunition
- Clothing and Armor
- Cyberware/bioware
- Fake SINs, fake licenses
- Cyberdeck Programs
- Tools
- Breaking and entering tools
- Surveillance equipment
- Lifestyle
- Vehicle(s)
- Drones (usually owned by riggers)
- Biotech
- Disguises
- Sensors and sensory enhancements
- Magical goods (foci, ritual materials, alchemical preparations, etc.)
- Certified credstick(s) (for extra cash)
- DocWagon Contract

Three major restrictions apply to purchases:

1. Attribute augmentations from cyberware or bioware are capped at +4 over natural ratings.
2. Gear is limited to Availability 12 and Device Rating 6 at creation.
3. All gear choices require gamemaster approval.

### Implementation Notes

- Build a budget tracker that pulls Resource priority value, handles Karma-to-nuyen conversion, and enforces the 5,000¥ carryover limit.
- Present searchable catalogues for gear, augmentations, and lifestyle options with costs, availability, and device ratings.
- Flag purchases exceeding availability/device limits or violating metatype modifiers (e.g., troll lifestyle costs).
- Queue expenditures for later validation (e.g., ammunition quantity checks once inventory systems exist).

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Six questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-six-spend-your-resources).

### Cyberware and Bioware

Cyberware and bioware enhance or replace parts of the body. Cyberware is mechanical, bioware is living tissue. Cyberware usually costs more Essence; bioware is more expensive in nuyen.

Racial bonuses can be lost when replacing body parts. For example, cybereyes remove an elf’s natural low-light vision unless the implant includes that modification. Orthoskin replaces a troll’s dermal deposits, eliminating the natural +1 dermal armor unless supplemented.

Cyberware/bioware grades include standard, alphaware, betaware, and deltaware (p. 451). Only standard and alphaware are available during character creation.

Essence loss affects magic users and technomancers severely: every fractional point of Essence lost reduces Magic or Resonance by 1. A magician with Magic 5 who installs rating 4 cybereyes drops to Essence 5.5 and Magic 4. The magician can lose another 0.5 Essence without penalty, but dropping below 5.0 reduces Magic again. Extensive augmentations can burn out magical or Resonance abilities entirely (see Magic Loss, p. 278, and Resonance Loss, p. 249).

Attributes boosted by augmentations do not affect calculations for Knowledge skills or Contacts, but they alter Initiative and Inherent Limits. When computing the Social limit, round remaining Essence up to the nearest whole number. Record augmented attributes on the sheet as `rating (augmented rating)`—for example, Strength 4 (6) after adding muscle augmentation 2.

### Implementation Notes

- Provide augmentation selection UI that tracks Essence costs, grade modifiers, nuyen costs, and attribute bonuses.
- Automatically decrement Magic/Resonance when Essence thresholds are crossed and warn when ratings approach zero.
- Handle replacement of racial traits (e.g., auto-remove natural low-light vision when cybereyes installed) and note compensating upgrades.
- Display augmented vs. natural attribute values for later derived calculations.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Cyberware & Bioware questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#cyberware--bioware).

### Lifestyle

Lifestyle defines day-to-day living conditions and monthly expenses. Options include Street, Squatter, Low, Middle, High, and Luxury. Choose a lifestyle that fits the character concept and budget.

**Lifestyle Costs Table**

| LIFESTYLE | COST     |
| --------- | -------- |
| Street    | Free     |
| Squatter  | 500¥     |
| Low       | 2,000¥   |
| Middle    | 5,000¥   |
| High      | 10,000¥  |
| Luxury    | 100,000¥ |

### Implementation Notes

- Offer lifestyle selection UI with costs, descriptive text, and automatic application of troll cost multipliers or quality modifiers.
- Integrate lifestyle purchase into overall resource budget and record monthly upkeep for campaign tracking.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Lifestyle & Starting Nuyen questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#lifestyle--starting-nuyen).

### Starting Nuyen

Starting nuyen depends on chosen lifestyle and a dice roll specified by the Starting Nuyen Table. Add the roll result to any unspent funds (up to the 5,000¥ carryover limit).

**Starting Nuyen Table**

| LIFESTYLE | STARTING NUYEN |
| --------- | -------------- |
| Street    | 1D6 x 20¥      |
| Squatter  | 2D6 x 40¥      |
| Low       | 3D6 x 60¥      |
| Middle    | 4D6 x 100¥     |
| High      | 5D6 x 500¥     |
| Luxury    | 6D6 x 1,000¥   |

### Implementation Notes

- Add a helper that rolls or allows manual entry of starting nuyen per lifestyle table, applying carryover correctly.
- Store final starting funds for downstream systems (equipment purchase, session zero handoff).

- See [Lifestyle & Starting Nuyen questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#lifestyle--starting-nuyen).

## Step Seven: Spend Your Leftover Karma

This step is the last opportunity to polish the character before final calculations. By now, you should understand the character concept and mechanics. Spend remaining Karma to smooth rough edges, improve skills or attributes, buy spells, acquire bound spirits, bond foci, or purchase contacts. Consult the Additional Purchases and Restrictions table to confirm any limitations. You may carry over up to 7 Karma into play.

**Spending Leftover Karma (p.98):**

- Your leftover Karma amount is 25 - (Positive Quality cost) + (Negative Quality value)
- All limits from the above steps are still in force (e.g. only one Physical or Mental attribute at maximum, skill levels cannot exceed 6)
- Note that in this stage you are now allowed to break up Skill Groups by improving individual skills in that group with Karma, or purchasing Specializations.
- Conversions (all conversion done at standard Character Advancement Rates p. 103)
  - Physical and Mental Attribute levels increase at (new level × 5) Karma. Going from 5 to 6 Strength would cost 30 Karma.
    - Note that you cannot have more than 1 Mental or Physical Attribute at the maximum during character generation.
  - All Special Attributes can also be raised with Karma at the same cost as Physical and Mental attributes.
    - You may have all your Special Attributes maxed out if you wish.
  - **Active** skill levels increase at (new level × 2) Karma.
    - Note that Active skills cannot exceed 6 in character creation (excluding Aptitude)
  - **Knowledge and Language** skill levels increase at (new level ×1) Karma.
    - Note that Knowledge skills cannot exceed 6 in character creation (excluding Aptitude)
    - Note that Language skills cannot ever exceed 6.
    - Note that skills cannot exceed 6 in character creation (excluding Aptitude)
  - **Skill Groups** can be increased at (new level × 5) Karma.
  - Complex Forms cost 4 Karma each.
  - New spells cost 5 Karma each.
  - 1 Karma per Bound Spirit service (Force = charater's Magic level)
  - 1 Karma per Registered Spirit task
  - Bond Foci: see page 318
- Contacts
  - You receive free "Contacts Karma" equal to Charisma × 3
    - This can only be used to acquire or improve Contacts.
  - Increasing Loyalty or Connections levels requires 1 Karma point each
  - All Contacts must have at least 1 Connections and 1 Loyalty level, which means the minimum Karma cost for a Contact is 2.
  - A single Contact cannot have more than 7 Karma (including "Contact Karma") spent on them.
    - This means you are capped to 1/6, 6/1, 4/3, etc.
- You cannot start the game with more than 7 Karma.

Remember ongoing creation limits: only one attribute at its natural maximum, gear Availability no higher than 12, and Device Rating no higher than 6.

When spending Karma on attributes or skills, follow the advancement rules in Character Advancement (p. 103).

### Contacts

Contacts are vital. They supply gear, jobs, information, and favors. Every character receives free Karma equal to Charisma × 3 to spend on initial contacts.

Each contact has two ratings:

- **Connection**: Reach and influence in the shadows and beyond.
- **Loyalty**: Willingness to help the runner.

Both ratings must be at least 1. Loyalty 1–2 represents a business relationship; higher loyalty indicates friendship and greater risk tolerance. Refer to p. 386 for detailed rules.

**Example Contacts**: Arms dealer, Smuggler, Mobster, Corporate wageslave, Fixer, Talismonger (seller of magical goods), Beat cop on the take, Rigger, Mechanic, Street doc

**Additional Purchases & Restrictions (At Character Creation)**

| ITEM                                                        | KARMA COST                                                                                                    |

| Bond Foci                                                   | Variable; see p. 318 for bonding costs of foci                                                                |
| Contacts                                                    | 1 Karma for each point of Connections Rating, 1 Karma for each Loyalty Rating (minimum Karma requirement = 2) |
| Registering Sprites                                         | 1 Karma per task (Level of Sprite equal to Character's Resonance Rating)                                      |

- Maximum number of complex forms at character creation equal to Logic Attribute
- Maximum number of spells/rituals/preparations known at Character Creation equals Magic Rating x 2
- Maximum total Force of all foci that can be bonded at character creation is equal to character's Magic Rating x 2
- A single contact may not have more than 7 Karma spent on them at character creation.
- There are no limits on how many contacts the character may purchase
- Can only have a number of Registered Sprites equal to the character's Charisma

### Implementation Notes

- Provide a Karma management panel that lists pending purchases (skills, spells, Power Points, contacts) and enforces the 7 Karma carryover cap.
- Support upgrading attributes/skills per Character Advancement costs and lock out illegal moves (e.g., exceeding natural maxima).
- Build a contacts manager that tracks Connection/Loyalty, free Karma allocation (Charisma × 3), and notes for each contact.
- Handle specialization purchases that break skill groups and adjust future advancement paths automatically.

## Step Eight: Final Calculations

After spending resources and Karma, compute derived mechanics. Many depend on final attribute and augmentation choices.

**Final Calculations Table**

| MECHANIC                        | FORMULA                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |

**Inherent Limits:**

- Mental Limit is [(Logic × 2) + Intuition + Willpower] / 3 (round up)
- Physical Limit is [(Strength × 2) + Body + Reaction] / 3 (round up)
- Social Limit is [(Charisma × 2) + Willpower + Essence] / 3 (round up)

**Initiative**: Intuition + Reaction. List natural and augmented values (e.g., 9 (11) + 2D6). Note additional initiative dice from augmentations. Initiative determines the order that characters act in combat situations. Initiative is also rolled to determine whether a character is surprised in a combat situation. Both non-augmented and augmented attributes should be added together and listed the same as attributes, with the non-augmented number first followed by the augmented number in parentheses. Also be sure to note the number of Initiative Dice the character gets; all characters start with 1 (noted as 1D6) and can receive additional dice from augmentations.

**Matrix Initiative** and **Astral Initiative**: Determined by mode (cold-sim, hot-sim) or astral rules. Matrix Initiative is determined by whether a character is in cold-sim or hot-sim.

**Inherent Limits**: Calculated using formulas above. Round up to the nearest whole number. When computing the Social limit, round Essence up before applying the formula. Inherent limits are limits imposed on a character by their physiological or psychological makeup; all characters have them.

**Condition Monitors**: Determine Physical and Stun monitor boxes per the formulas above. Every character has a Condition Monitor that tells the player how much Physical and Stun damage they can take before falling unconscious.

**Living Persona** (technomancers): Technomancers possess what is called a Living Persona in the Matrix. This Living Persona has specific attributes that are used instead of their normal physical or mental attributes. See the Living Persona section in the table above.

**Character Creation Checklist**

To make sure your character is ready to rock with a minimum of complication and hassle, here's a checklist of things to remember when designing a shadowrunner:

- Make sure you choose each row of the Priority Table once.
- Remember to make note of any applicable racial advantages or disadvantages (thermal vision, lowlight vision) on your character sheet for game play.
- Check to make sure you have raised your Edge and/or Magic or Resonance with your special attribute points that your character received when you selected your metatype.
- Make sure you have spent all your attribute points.
  - Your character may only have one Physical or Mental Attribute at the natural attribute maximum limit (or 1 higher with the Exceptional Attribute quality) at character creation. This rule does not apply to Edge, Magic, or Resonance. These can be at their maximum if the player has the points to raise them that far.
- In the Magic or Resonance column, doublecheck to make sure you have recorded all the benefits from that priority level on your character sheet (if applicable). Aspected magicians only receive skills from the one category they select (Sorcery, Conjuring, or Enchanting) they select. Mystic adepts do not get their Power Points for free like other adepts, but must spend 5 Karma per Power Point.
- Review the qualities that you have purchased and make all requisite changes to your stats. Make certain to note the bonuses or negative modifiers on your character sheet.
- Check to make sure you have spent all your skill and skill group points on Active, Knowledge, and Language skills. Make sure you have all the specializations that you desire from spending priority points. Review skill groups and the individual skills you have bought to verify there are no duplications.
- Review the gear that you have purchased with your resources. Make sure you have acquired everything you want, and double-check for things you may have forgotten (commlinks, cyberdecks, ammo, vehicles, Lifestyles, fake SINs and licenses, etc.). If you are playing a dwarf or a troll, make certain you have taken their gear cost modifiers into consideration. You may convert up to 10 Karma into nuyen (20,000 nuyen). You may carry over 5,000 nuyen from your resources and add them to your starting nuyen.
- Make sure you have calculated your Essence, Initiative, and Inherent Limits, and acquired contacts.
- Review your Karma expenditures, and spend any remaining that you wish. Remember, you can carry up to 7 Karma from character creation into the game.

### Implementation Notes

- Automate derived statistic calculations using stored attribute and augmentation data, with breakdowns for natural vs. augmented values.
- Display formula inputs and outputs for verification and allow manual overrides with GM approval.
- Include prompts for Matrix/Astral initiative only when relevant (e.g., technomancer, awakened character).

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Eight questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-eight-final-calculations).

## Step Nine: Final Touches

With mechanics in place, secure gamemaster approval. The GM may request adjustments to better fit the campaign. Be flexible and collaborate to ensure a fun experience.

Even though the stats are done and the character sheet is filled out, you're not quite finished. You still need to get the gamemaster approval before play begins. Hopefully, the gamemaster has been actively involved in this process, guiding character creation to help ensure the campaign is both fun and satisfying. If the gamemaster was not involved in the character creation process, players may need to make revisions to their characters that will allow them to get the most out of the campaign the gamemaster envisions running.

For a successful game, all parties should be willing to be flexible and make adjustments that will work for everyone while playing and enjoying Shadowrun.

Flesh out the character's backstory. Qualities, attributes, and contacts provide a blueprint, but narrative details bring them to life. In the final stage you should also flesh out the backstory for the character. Qualities, attribute ratings, and contacts provide a blueprint of who these characters are now. But what are their stories? Why are they shadowrunners? What aliases are they known by? How did they earn their street names? Their scars? What are their real names? Who are their friends? Their enemies? How old are they? If a character possesses a piece of gear that they cannot use right now, what is the story behind that? If they have cyberlimbs, was that by choice or out of necessity? The more interesting the background, the more possibilities for interesting role-playing scenarios that can add flavor and diversity to a game.

### Implementation Notes

- Provide a final review screen summarizing priorities, metatype, attributes, skills, gear, and derived stats for GM sign-off.
- Offer export options (PDF, JSON, print-friendly) and space for narrative notes/backstory.
- Track approval status and revisions to support iterative updates.

### Open Questions & Data Gaps

- See [Step Nine questions](./questions-and-gaps.md#step-nine-final-touches).

## Character Advancement

Character generation is only the start. Your character will go on some runs, pick up some Karma and nuyen, and then look for ways to get better at what he does. Character advancement rules tell you how to build your runner from a street novice to a big, bad, fire-breathing street legend.

Karma advancement works similar to the way you spent Karma at the end of character creation to customize the character, improve skills and attributes, and purchase things like bound spirits and registered sprites, but with one fundamental difference. When you create your character, it's assumed your character has taken the time needed to develop and improve whatever skills he possesses. Once roleplaying starts, though, he's going to need time to get better at his skills. He cannot, for example, simply rise from a Blades skill of 5 to Blades 6 overnight. He must train, possibly under the instruction of a master, and practice, practice, practice to improve his skill. This training and practice normally takes place during the runner's downtime.

The time it takes to improve an attribute or skill is meant to reflect the in-world time a character must invest in improving his abilities and is measured in days, weeks, or months. The higher the rating in a skill or attribute, the more difficult and time-consuming it is to advance to the next level. Some qualities, such as Dependents, extend this timeframe. This training time can be interrupted by going out on runs or doing other activities, but the character must resume his interrupted training as quickly as possible. Waiting too long before getting back into training can result in losing the benefits of previous sessions and having to start from the beginning again. Karma for the new or improved rating of an attribute or skill does not need to be paid until the character has fully completed their training period.

The time it takes to improve attributes cannot be decreased. Building muscle for Body or Strength, or improving cognitive functions, always takes a serious investment of time. Note that you can't improve Physical or Mental attributes during the same downtime period when you receive implants or augmentations that improve those same attributes. That downtime is used solely for recovery from the augmentation implanting process and for getting used to their body's new modifications. The character will have to wait to the next downtime to begin training for another improvement. A character may only train to improve one Mental and one Physical attribute, or one attribute and one skill, in a single downtime period.

Skills can be taught for improvement purposes. If the player is able to find an instructor to train him and help him perfect his techniques, the time it takes improve his skill is reduced by 25 percent (round down). If the character chooses to focus on improving only skills during a downtime, the character may choose to learn or improve a number of skills up to their Logic rating divided by 2 (round up). Specializations for skills take 1 month of dedicated training to learn and cannot be learned at the same time as anything else. Skill groups are improved at a rate of [new Rating] x 2 weeks. A character in the process of training to improve a skill group cannot learn or improve any other attributes or skills at the same time. Improving a skill group is considered time consuming and focus intensive.

Edge is a unique quality. Because it reflects the character's luck, it requires no special amount of time to raise. Edge can be raised anytime the character has the Karma to do so.

### Attribute and Skill Advancement Costs

The cost to improve an attribute is new Rating x 5 Karma.

The maximum number of ratings you can increase a single Attribute by in any given period of downtime during a campaign is 2. If you wish to raise the Attribute any further, you will have to wait for more downtime.

Active Skill ratings costs are computed at new Rating x 2. If you are purchasing a brand new skill, find the desired rating on the table and pay that cumulative amount. For example, if you are purchasing the running skill for the first time, and are buying it up to Rating 3, you will pay 12 Karma. To go from 7 to 8 in a skill, you will pay 16 Karma (rating 8 x 2 Karma). To calculate the cost of jumping more than one level, subtract the number in the column with your current Rating from the number in the column with your desired higher Rating. A character may raise the Rating of their Active skills up by a maximum of 3 rating points per any one downtime. To raise the skill(s) any further, they have to wait for another period of downtime.

Knowledge and Language skills work in a similar manner, though their cost is only new Rating x 1. A character may raise the Rating of their Knowledge or Language skills up by a maximum of 3 rating points per any one downtime.

Active Skill Groups cost new Rating x 5 to raise and can only be raised by 1 rating per downtime.

### Learning Complex Forms

To gain access to a new complex form, a technomancer must spend 4 Karma. Details on learning complex forms can be found in the Resonance Library section.

### Learning Magic

Aspected magicians, magicians, and mystic adepts may purchase new spells, rituals, or preparations to use. The magic user must spend 5 Karma to learn the spell, ritual, or preparation. For details on how to learn magic, see the Magic chapter.

### Qualities in Play

There are two ways for a character to pick up new qualities. First, they can be assigned by the gamemaster as a result of events or actions in the course of a campaign. Positive qualities may be assigned as reward for good roleplaying, while Negative qualities may be assigned if something traumatic or significant happens or the character does something for which the Negative quality is a reasonable consequence ("reasonable" is defined by the gamemaster). A player may also purchase Positive qualities for his character at any time during game play. The cost for purchasing a Positive quality during game play is the listed Karma cost x 2. Similarly, if a character wishes to get rid of a Negative quality, has met any stipulated requirements, and the gamemaster has given the player permission, the player may do so at a rate of listed Karma x 2.
