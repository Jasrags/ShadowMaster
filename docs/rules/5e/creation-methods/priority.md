# Shadowrun 5E – Priority Character Creation

_Last updated: 2025-11-10_

The Priority system is the standard character creation method for Shadowrun 5th Edition. Players assign the letters A–E uniquely across five columns: Metatype, Attributes, Magic/Resonance, Skills, and Resources.

## Overview

Each priority level (A through E) grants specific benefits:
- **Priority A:** Highest tier benefits
- **Priority B:** Strong benefits
- **Priority C:** Moderate benefits
- **Priority D:** Basic benefits
- **Priority E:** Minimal benefits

Each column must receive a unique priority level—no duplicates allowed.

## Priority Columns

1. **Metatype:** Determines metatype selection and special attribute points
2. **Attributes:** Attribute point pool for physical and mental attributes
3. **Magic/Resonance:** Magic or Resonance rating and related resources
4. **Skills:** Skill points and skill groups
5. **Resources:** Starting nuyen
