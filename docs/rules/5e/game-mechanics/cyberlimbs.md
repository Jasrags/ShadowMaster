# Cyberlimbs

In today's world of transplant-friendly bioware, the use of cyberlimbs is sometimes viewed as crude and outdated. On the other hand, they are cheap and easy to service and upgrade, so in the end they became even more popular for the less fortunate. Since cyberlimbs are more capable than most natural limbs, and you can load them up with all sorts of wiz tech, this kind of cyberware has stayed in high demand.

Cyberskulls and torsos are included in the "cyberlimbs" category, though they are in fact shells rather than full replacements (or actual limbs).

## Attribute Mechanics

Cyberlimbs have their own **Strength** and **Agility** ratings. When a particular limb is used for a test (such as leading an attack with your cyberarm), use the attribute for that limb (natural or cyber); in any other case, take the average value of all limbs involved in the task. If a task requires the careful coordination of several limbs, use the value of the weakest limb.

The attributes of partial limbs (including cyberhands and feet) may be enhanced, but their attributes only apply for tests directly involving those limbs (such as a Strength Test when gripping something with an enhanced cyberhand).

**Restrictions:** Cyberlimbs cannot hold any bioware, nor any cyber-implants that take up Essence rather than Capacity. Essence cost, Capacity, and other stats can be found on the Cyberlimb table.

## Features

Cyberlimbs have several useful features:

- **Physical Condition Monitor Bonus:** 1 extra damage box on your Physical Condition Monitor for each cyberlimb you possess (ignore hands and feet; partial limbs count for half a limb)
- **Capacity:** Lets you add cyberweapons and other cyber systems that have a Capacity cost [in brackets]
- **Superhuman Performance:** Can perform at superhuman levels with the right enhancements
- **Unarmed Damage:** Cyberlimbs are dangerous even without cyberweapons installed—their unarmed Damage Value is **(STR)P**

## Standard Cyberlimbs

These prosthetics are basic off-the-shelf models. All standard cyberlimbs come with **Strength and Agility attributes of 3**. These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.

## Customization

You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb's base Strength and/or Agility ratings.

- Each increase of either attribute increases the limb's Availability and cost
- If either of your limb's attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can't use the cyberlimb (so don't overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements
- You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can't customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements

## Appearance Types

Cyberlimbs may be either **obvious** or **synthetic**.

### Obvious Cyberlimbs

These implants are immediately recognizable as artificial limbs unless you cover them with clothing. They are often chromed or matte colors but visibly mechanical in nature. Some folks like them glaringly obvious and outlandish, some find the artificiality repellent and disturbing. This can affect your social dealings in some circles, especially upper-crust society and the purist crowd.

### Synthetic Cyberlimbs

Synthetic limbs are disguised as natural limbs. The fact that they're cybernetic gives them a **-8 Concealability** (the Cybertechnology skill may replace Perception for this test) when someone's just looking.

---

# Cyberlimb Enhancements

Cyberlimb enhancements use up to the Capacity of the cyberlimb they enhance. There are three types of enhancement:

| Enhancement | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| **Agility** | Adds Rating to the limb's Agility attribute |
| **Armor** | Provides an Armor bonus equal to Rating, cumulative with other armor, without adding to Encumbrance |
| **Strength** | Adds Rating to the limb's Strength attribute |

**Stacking Rules:** Each limb can have only one enhancement of each type (you can't stack two Strength 3 enhancements in the same cyberarm), but you can replace one you have with one you want.

---

# Cyberlimb Accessories

These items may only be installed in cyberlimbs; some may only be installed in certain cyberlimbs.

## Cyberarm Gyromount

Must be installed in a full or partial cyberarm. When activated, counterweights pop out of your wrist and a small gyro spins up to provide you with better balance and reduced recoil for improving firing capability. Meanwhile, small children stare at you.

- Effects are identical to a gyro stabilization system (p. 432), only with **Rating 3**
- This effect is not cumulative with a worn gyro stabilization system
- Activating or deactivating the system is a **Simple Action**

**Wireless:** Activating or deactivating the system is a **Free Action**.

## Cyberarm Slide

An integral version of the hidden arm-slide, the cyberarm slide hides a hold-out, taser, or light pistol inside your cyberarm, concealing it from normal vision. As a **Free Action**, you can ready the weapon in the slide.

## Cyber Holster

You can hold a taser or any pistol- or smaller-sized weapon within the holster, completely enclosed until you activate it. Inserting or retrieving a weapon takes one **Simple Action**. A cyber holster can also be used as a smuggling compartment to store items no larger than a pistol (the gamemaster has final discretion).

**Wireless:** Readying a weapon from the holster is a **Free Action**.

## Hydraulic Jacks

This implant requires you to have two cyberlegs with a hydraulic jack of identical Ratings in each leg.

Each Rating point:
- Adds **+1** to your Physical limit for jumping and sprinting
- Adds **20%** to your maximum jump distance
- Reduces your falling distance by **2 meters** for calculating falling damage

**Wireless:** The jacks add a **+1 dice pool bonus** to tests involving jumping, sprinting, or lifting with your legs.

## Large Smuggling Compartment

This is a larger version of the smuggling compartment (p. 455). It can hold something the size of a heavy pistol or a small SMG (gamemaster's discretion—think breadbox size as a guide). Getting something out of or putting something into it takes a **Complex Action**.

**Wireless:** Getting something out of or putting something into it takes a **Simple Action**.

---

# Cyber Implant Weapons

Cyber-implant weapons can be installed into cyberlimbs or directly into the meat. They're popular with the denizens of urban wastelands like the Barrens, and with street samurai who never want to go anywhere unarmed.

## Cyberguns

Generally speaking, these are mounted in a cyberarm or directly into a natural arm, but you could install one in a leg or even your torso. Cyberguns are distinct from cyber holsters in that the gun itself can be controlled and fired directly, as an extension of your body.

Depending on the size of the gun, cyberguns take up part of your forearm or replace your arm altogether, with the functional parts of the arm built around the gun. Smaller cyberguns fire through a hidden port in the palm or knuckles, while larger cyberguns fold back the user's hand at the wrist.

**Concealment:** For extra concealment, cyberguns are built from mostly non-metallic compounds, and any metallic parts are incorporated into the (cyber) arm's structure.

**Features:**
- All cyberguns have internal magazines (m) and can be equipped with a hidden external ammo port
- Once you attach a clip to the side of your forearm or the back of your elbow, the cybergun becomes kind of obvious
- Laser sights and silencers/sound suppressors are available; other weapon accessories can't be installed in cyberguns
- All cyberguns are pre-equipped with smartgun systems (p. 433)

## Cyber Melee Weapons

For a quarter of a century now, cyber-implant melee weapons have been the classic, favored toys of razor guys, from street muscle to professional urban samurai. They are available as cyberarm upgrades, but can also be installed directly into the flesh.

**Activation:** Cyber weapons can be readied via muscle flexture, neural impulse, or wireless signal.

**Combat:** Attacks with cyber melee weapons use **Unarmed Combat** skill and the **Physical limit**.

### Hand Razors

Blades two to three centimeters long, made of chromed steel or carbon fiber. They either slide out from beneath your fingernails or replace them entirely.

### Hand Blades

Slip out the side of the hand opposite the thumb, parallel to the hand. While they are universally thin and sharp, they come in a variety of shapes and styles.

### Spurs

One to three blades or spikes protruding from the back of your wrist or your knuckles, sticking out from your fist as much as thirty centimeters.

### Shock Hand

Like a shock glove built into the palm of your hand, perfect for inflicting a nasty shock to anything it comes into contact with.

- Deals **Electricity damage** (p. 170)
- Has **10 charges** in each hand
- When plugged in, recharges at a rate of **1 charge per 10 seconds**

# Implementation Guidance

> **Governing Documents:**
> - [Capability: character.augmentation-systems](docs/capabilities/character.augmentation-systems.md)
> - [ADR-010: Inventory State Management](docs/decisions/010-gear.inventory-state-management.md)
> - [ADR-011: Sheet-Driven Creation](docs/decisions/011-character.sheet-driven-creation.md)

## Capability Alignment

Per `character.augmentation-systems`, cyberlimb implementation MUST:

1. **Essence Tracking**: Every cyberlimb installation results in verifiable Essence reduction using grade multipliers
2. **Capacity Management**: Cyberlimbs provide capacity; enhancements/accessories consume it
3. **Attribute Bonuses**: Provide measurable, auditable bonuses to STR/AGI
4. **Wireless State**: Track per-limb wireless enabled/disabled with structured bonus effects (per ADR-010)
5. **Persistent Record**: Maintain auditable history of all modifications

## Attribute Calculation Rules

### Effective Attribute Determination

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| Single limb action (e.g., punch with cyberarm) | Use that limb's STR or AGI |
| Multiple limbs, general action | Average all involved limbs (natural = racial base) |
| Coordinated action requiring precision | Use the **weakest** limb's value |
| Partial limb (hand/foot) | Only applies to tests directly involving that part |

### Limb Attribute Formula

```
Limb STR = Base (3) + Customization Bonus + Enhancement Bonus
Limb AGI = Base (3) + Customization Bonus + Enhancement Bonus
```

**Constraints:**
- Customization: 0 to (Racial Maximum - 3), set at purchase, immutable
- Enhancement: 0 to 3 (Rating of installed enhancement)
- Total cannot exceed Racial Maximum + 4 (per augmentation rules)

### Averaging Formula (Multiple Limbs)

For actions involving multiple limbs:
```
Effective Attribute = floor(sum(all involved limb attributes) / count(involved limbs))
```

Natural limbs use the character's racial base attribute (before augmentation bonuses from other sources).

## Physical Condition Monitor Bonus

| Limb Type | CM Bonus |
|-----------|----------|
| Full arm | +1 |
| Full leg | +1 |
| Torso | +1 |
| Skull | +1 |
| Lower arm | +0.5 |
| Lower leg | +0.5 |
| Hand/foot | +0 (ignored) |

**Formula:** `Extra CM Boxes = floor(sum of all limb bonuses)`

## Customization vs Enhancement

| Aspect | Customization | Enhancement |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| When applied | Purchase only | Post-purchase allowed |
| Modifies | Base attribute | Adds to total |
| Uses capacity | No | Yes (Rating per type) |
| Availability impact | +1 per point | Separate availability check |
| Cost impact | +5,000¥ per point | Rating × cost multiplier |
| Maximum | Racial natural max | +3 per enhancement type |
| Mutable | No | Yes (can replace) |
| Grade affects | No (flat cost) | Yes (cost × grade multiplier) |

## Capacity System

### Capacity Notation

- **Plain number** (e.g., `15`): Capacity the limb provides
- **Bracketed number** (e.g., `[8]`): Capacity the item consumes

### Capacity Budget

```
Available Capacity = Limb Base Capacity - Sum([consumed by enhancements, accessories, weapons])
```

**Constraint:** Available Capacity MUST remain ≥ 0

### Obvious vs Synthetic Capacity

Synthetic limbs have **reduced capacity** compared to obvious equivalents (trade-off for concealment).

## Cost & Availability Calculations

### Final Limb Cost

```
Total Cost = (Base Limb Cost × Grade Multiplier)
           + (Customization Points × 5,000¥)
           + Sum(Enhancement/Accessory Costs × Grade Multiplier)
```

### Final Availability

```
Limb Availability = Base Availability + Customization Points + Grade Modifier
Enhancement Availability = Calculated per enhancement (separate checks)
```

## Data Model Requirements

Per ADR-010, cyberlimbs follow the unified gear state model:

### Cyberlimb Entity

```typescript
interface CyberlimbItem {
  // Identity
  id: string;
  catalogId: string;
  name: string;

  // Location
  location: CyberlimbLocation;        // e.g., "left-arm", "right-leg", "torso"
  limbType: CyberlimbType;            // "full-arm" | "lower-arm" | "hand" | etc.
  appearance: "obvious" | "synthetic";

  // Essence & Grade
  grade: CyberwareGrade;
  baseEssenceCost: number;
  essenceCost: number;                // After grade multiplier

  // Capacity
  baseCapacity: number;
  capacityUsed: number;

  // Attributes (Cyberlimb-specific)
  baseStrength: 3;                    // Always 3
  baseAgility: 3;                     // Always 3
  customStrength: number;             // 0 to (racial max - 3)
  customAgility: number;              // 0 to (racial max - 3)

  // Installed Items
  enhancements: CyberlimbEnhancement[];
  accessories: CyberlimbAccessory[];
  weapons: CyberImplantWeapon[];

  // State (per ADR-010)
  wirelessEnabled: boolean;
  condition: "working" | "bricked" | "permanently_bricked";

  // Audit
  installedAt: ISO8601Timestamp;
  modificationHistory: ModificationEntry[];
}
```

### Location Tracking

```typescript
type CyberlimbLocation =
  | "left-arm" | "right-arm"
  | "left-leg" | "right-leg"
  | "left-hand" | "right-hand"
  | "left-foot" | "right-foot"
  | "left-lower-arm" | "right-lower-arm"
  | "left-lower-leg" | "right-lower-leg"
  | "torso"
  | "skull";
```

### Limb Hierarchy (Replacement Rules)

Installing a full limb replaces any partial limbs in that location:

```
full-arm replaces: lower-arm, hand (same side)
full-leg replaces: lower-leg, foot (same side)
lower-arm replaces: hand (same side)
lower-leg replaces: foot (same side)
```

## Wireless Bonus Effects

Per ADR-010, wireless bonuses require structured `wirelessEffects` for mechanical calculation:

| Accessory | Wireless Bonus | Structured Effect |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Gyromount | Activate/deactivate as Free Action | `{ "type": "action_economy", "action": "toggle_gyromount", "from": "simple", "to": "free" }` |
| Cyber holster | Ready weapon as Free Action | `{ "type": "action_economy", "action": "ready_from_holster", "from": "simple", "to": "free" }` |
| Hydraulic jacks | +1 dice pool to jumping/sprinting/lifting | `{ "type": "dice_pool", "skills": ["jumping", "sprinting", "lifting"], "modifier": 1 }` |
| Large smuggling compartment | Access as Simple Action | `{ "type": "action_economy", "action": "access_compartment", "from": "complex", "to": "simple" }` |

## Validation Rules

### At Character Creation

1. **Availability Limit**: Final availability (with customization) ≤ 12
2. **Essence Minimum**: Total essence cost cannot reduce Essence below 0.01
3. **Customization Cap**: Cannot exceed character's natural racial maximum
4. **Capacity Budget**: Cannot install items exceeding limb capacity
5. **No Duplicates**: Cannot have two limbs in same location

### Post-Creation

1. **Karma/Nuyen**: Adding augmentations requires resources
2. **Capacity Check**: New items must fit remaining capacity
3. **Grade Upgrade Only**: Can upgrade grade (Standard → Alpha), cannot downgrade
4. **Enhancement Replacement**: Can replace enhancement of same type (not stack)

## Edge Cases

### Partial Limb Attribute Application

Partial limbs (hands, feet, lower arms/legs) only apply their attributes when:
- The test **directly** involves that specific part
- Example: Cyberhand STR applies to grip tests, but NOT to full-arm pushing

### Cyber Melee Weapon STR Reference

When calculating damage for cyber melee weapons:
- If installed in cyberlimb: Use **limb's STR**
- If installed in meat: Use **character's natural STR**

### Mixed Limb Averaging

When averaging across natural and cyber limbs:
- Natural limbs use character's base racial attribute
- Cyber limbs use their calculated total (base + custom + enhancement)
- Round down after averaging
