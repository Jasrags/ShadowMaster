- Need official validation on special attribute caps when Qualities (Lucky, Exceptional Attribute) are present.

### Step Three: Choose Magic or Resonance
- Need complete Magic/Resonance priority table: starting attribute ratings, spell/skill/complex form bundles, Power Point grants.

- Need specialization options or guidance (free-form vs. predefined) for each skill.
- Confirm exact cost formulae when aptitudes, qualities, or other modifiers apply.

### Knowledge & Language Skills
- Need canonical Knowledge and Language skill examples or lists for guided selection.

- Clarify maximum carryover Karma and any campaign-specific overrides.

### Step Eight: Final Calculations
- Need explicit formula references for all derived stats (limits, monitors, initiative variants) and any edge cases (qualities, augmentations).
- Clarify rounding conventions beyond those noted (e.g., Reaction rounding for initiative dice).

### Step Nine: Final Touches
- Need example contact lists with Connection/Loyalty ratings for typical archetypes.
- Provide lifestyle templates with monthly costs, amenities, and upgrade options.
  - Addressed via `shadowrun-5e-character.md` (Lifestyle Management section) and `shadowrun-5e-data-tables.md` (Lifestyle & Economy tables).

## Attributes

## Qualities Data
- Add summary table for Addiction severity (dosage requirements, craving frequency, penalties).
