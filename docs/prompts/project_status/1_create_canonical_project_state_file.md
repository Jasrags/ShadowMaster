Scan the repository and identify:

- All spec or design documents
- Any README or overview files

Create a single canonical PROJECT_STATE.md that contains:

1. Current Focus (1–2 active milestones max)
2. Subsystem Status table with discrete states:
   - Not Started
   - Design Only
   - In Progress
   - Blocked
   - Implemented
   - Validated
3. Explicit blockers and dependencies
4. Last updated date

Rules:

- Do NOT modify any existing files
- If subsystem boundaries are unclear, infer and mark them as inferred
- Keep this file concise and factual

Output only PROJECT_STATE.md.
