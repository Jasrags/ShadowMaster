Review all spec documents and PROJECT_STATE.md.

Identify:

1. Specs that claim functionality not yet implemented
2. Implemented functionality not covered by any spec
3. Conflicting assumptions between specs

Rules:

- Do NOT modify any files
- Report issues as a checklist with references
- Distinguish between critical and non-critical drift
