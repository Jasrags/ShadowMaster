Given:

- PROJECT_STATE.md
- All spec documents

Answer:

1. What can be worked on next with no unresolved dependencies?
2. What work would unblock the most other systems?
3. What should explicitly NOT be worked on yet and why?

Constraints:

- Base answers only on documented dependencies and current state
- Prefer smallest unblocked units of work
- Be decisive, not exhaustive
