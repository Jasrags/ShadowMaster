Review all spec documents.

For each spec:

- Identify explicit or implied dependencies on other systems or specs
- Identify whether those dependencies appear implemented based on the repo

Produce:

1. A dependency list per spec
2. A list of specs that are currently blocked and why
3. A list of specs that appear unblocked and ready for work

Do NOT modify any files.
Do NOT speculate beyond what is stated or strongly implied.
