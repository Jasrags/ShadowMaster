You are updating project state, not design.

Inputs:

- PROJECT_STATE.md
- A summary of work I provide below (or a git diff)

Tasks:

1. Update PROJECT_STATE.md only
2. Change subsystem states where justified
3. Remove blockers that are resolved
4. Add new blockers if discovered
5. Keep changes minimal and factual

Rules:

- Do NOT edit spec documents
- Do NOT add plans or future work
- If uncertain, leave the state unchanged and note uncertainty

Output:

- Updated PROJECT_STATE.md
- A brief bullet list of what changed
