Choosing attributes
Points can be divided up between six of the nine attributes, Body, Quickness, Strength, Intelligence, Willpower, and Charisma. The other free Essence, Magic, and Reaction are determined by outside factors. The higher priority to attributes the more points you can spend. No attribute can be given more than 6 points or less than 1 point. A charcters race also affects their attributes based on the Racial Modifications Table. No character may start the game with any attribute higher than 6 (before applicable racial modifers) and none of a charcters Physical or Mental attributes can be less than 1. Essence, Magic, and Reaction follow their own rules. The final numbers you get after applying modifiers will be your attribute number.

Essence: All Characters begin with an essence of 6, that value decreses when you install cyberware in your character. Essence cannot be lowered to 0 or less. An essence of 0 means you are dead.

Magic: The only attribute that can have a value of 0 which means you are a mundane character. 

Reaction: Reaction is equal to quickness and Intelligence added together, divided by two, and rounded down.
