# Shadowrun Fifth Edition Questions & Gaps

This document consolidates outstanding data requirements and open questions identified across the SR5 documentation. Use it as the single reference point when prioritising follow-up research or implementation work.

## Character Creation

### Step Two: Choose Metatype
- Need full SR5 priority table values for Metatype and Attributes (including special attribute point grants).
- Require metatype attribute starting values, natural maximums, and special ability data in structured form.
- Confirm exact rules for doubled lifestyle costs and other metatype-specific economic modifiers.
- Need official validation on special attribute caps when Qualities (Lucky, Exceptional Attribute) are present.

### Step Three: Choose Magic or Resonance
- Need complete Magic/Resonance priority table: starting attribute ratings, spell/skill/complex form bundles, Power Point grants.
- Require official spell lists, complex forms, spirit options, and adept power catalogues for selection UIs.
- Clarify restrictions and benefits for aspected magicians (specific skill group contents, limitations).
- Need mechanics for technomancer complex forms and registered sprite limits during creation.

### Step Four: Purchase Qualities
- Need complete SR5 quality list with Karma costs, prerequisites, and mechanical effects.
- Require guidance on stacking rules, mutual exclusivity, and GM-approval flags.
- Confirm workflows for awarding GM-chosen Negative Qualities during creation.

### Step Five: Purchase Skills
- Require authoritative SR5 skill list, linked attributes, and descriptions.
- Need official skill group definitions (membership, maximum ratings) and how they interact with other rules.
- Need specialization options or guidance (free-form vs. predefined) for each skill.
- Confirm exact cost formulae when aptitudes, qualities, or other modifiers apply.

### Knowledge & Language Skills
- Need canonical Knowledge and Language skill examples or lists for guided selection.
- Clarify whether Knowledge skills default to Logic or Intuition when ambiguous.
- Confirm if any metatype or quality modifies free Knowledge/Language point calculations.

### Step Six: Spend Your Resources
- Need complete SR5 gear database with costs, availability, device ratings, and categories.
- Require Karma↔nuyen conversion limits confirmation (some tables may provide variants).
- Clarify how resource priority interacts with alternate creation levels (street, prime).

### Cyberware & Bioware
- Require detailed augmentation data: Essence costs, grade modifiers, availability, device ratings, attribute effects.
- Need rules for stacking augmentations, compatibility constraints, and cyberware capacity (e.g., limb capacity).
- Clarify procedure for inherent racial traits lost through augmentation and how to restore them via upgrades.

### Lifestyle & Starting Nuyen
- Need official lifestyle cost table, modifiers, and effects (starting nuyen adjustments, social modifiers, etc.).
- Need the exact Starting Nuyen table (dice pools and modifiers) for each lifestyle.

### Step Seven: Spend Your Leftover Karma
- Need Additional Purchases and Restrictions table to define what can be bought with Karma and associated costs.
- Require advancement cost tables for attributes, skills, specializations, spells, spirits, Power Points, and contacts.
- Clarify maximum carryover Karma and any campaign-specific overrides.

### Step Eight: Final Calculations
- Need explicit formula references for all derived stats (limits, monitors, initiative variants) and any edge cases (qualities, augmentations).
- Clarify rounding conventions beyond those noted (e.g., Reaction rounding for initiative dice).

### Step Nine: Final Touches
- Need decision on export formats and data schema for character handoff.
- Clarify whether GM feedback loop should be captured in-app (comments, versioning).

## Attributes
- Populate base ranges and metatype modifiers from SR5 tables.
- Document derived attribute formulas (Reaction, Initiative, Essence, etc.).
- Clarify special attribute behaviors (Edge, Magic, Resonance, Initiative dice).
- Add advancement cost references and augmentation effects.

## Skills Data
- Add missing active skill categories (e.g., ranged/combat subsets not yet captured).
- Fill in any remaining physical-adjacent active skills beyond the current tables.
- Expand social/knowledge lists where TODO markers remain.
- Provide matrix-specific skill entries (currently placeholder in data tables).

## Data Tables & Reference Content
- Populate spell catalog classifications.
- List technomancer complex forms and sprite options.
- Document adept power names/costs for selection UIs.
- Add gear inventory with costs, availability, and device ratings.
- Populate augmentation catalog (Essence cost, grade modifiers, attribute effects).
- Provide lifestyle tiers, monthly costs, and modifiers.
- Supply lifestyle-based starting nuyen rolls and modifiers.
- Document Karma↔nuyen conversion limits and rates.
- Capture post-creation advancement cost references (attributes, skills, spells, etc.).
- Include formulas for limits, condition monitors, initiative variants, and other derived stats.
- Record edge cases and rounding conventions once sourced.

## Qualities Data
- Add summary table for Addiction severity (dosage requirements, craving frequency, penalties).
