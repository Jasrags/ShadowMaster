# Persona: Alex "ZeroFrame" Tanaka

**Role:** Veteran Shadowrun Gamemaster
**Primary Goal:** Build, manage, and run complex Shadowrun campaigns digitally — while maintaining flexibility and narrative control.

---

## Profile Overview
- **Age:** 35–45
- **Occupation:** Software engineer by day, long-time Shadowrun GM by night.
- **Experience:** 10+ years of Shadowrun, multiple long-running campaigns. Knows 5e rules deeply, often tweaks house rules.
- **Playstyle:** Balanced between narrative and mechanics. Loves world-building and improvisation but also wants mechanical consistency.
- **Tech Skill:** Very comfortable with digital tools, spreadsheets, and automation. Uses Roll20 or Foundry but dislikes their clunky Shadowrun implementations.

---

## Motivations
- Wants **structure** without losing **creative control**.
- Seeks a system that **automates mechanics** (initiative, modifiers, combat states) so focus can stay on storytelling.
- Wants to **reuse content** across campaigns — NPCs, scenes, maps, notes.
- Needs **fast reference access** during live play: “What did they find in that datavault again?”
- Enjoys **customization and system tinkering** — maybe even scripting or modding automation rules.

---

## Pain Points
- Shadowrun’s math-heavy and detail-rich systems slow down play.
- Current tools (spreadsheets, PDFs, or VTTs) are fragmented; information lives in too many places.
- Prep work is inefficient — NPC stat blocks, scene details, and player info don’t connect.
- Combat flow is often interrupted by rules lookups.
- Memory tracking (contacts, clues, consequences) across sessions is hard.

## Goals

| **Prep Goals** | **Live Play Goals** | **Post-Session Goals** |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| Build a coherent campaign with reusable assets (NPCs, scenes, gear lists, factions). | Run combat and skill checks smoothly via automation. | Log what happened, adjust world state, and prep for next session. |
| Visualize campaign structure and pacing. | Access NPC data instantly within scenes. | Update characters, reputation, and consequences easily. |
| Tag and search notes and clues. | Trace what the group has learned or missed. | Export summaries or reports. |

---

## Behaviors
- Preps multiple sessions ahead but improvises details live.
- Often imports text or stats from PDFs or fan sources.
- Keeps notes digitally — prefers Markdown, Obsidian, or Notion-like UX.
- References rulebooks constantly but knows them well enough to only need quick lookups.
- Uses dice automation tools but distrusts anything that hides rolls completely.

# Workflow: “Building & Running a Campaign”

Here’s a **high-level flow** of how Alex would use your web app, reflecting their natural GM process and desired automation.

---

## 1. Campaign Creation
- **Start New Campaign** → name, theme, tone, and edition (Shadowrun 5e).
- Add **player characters** (either imported or manually entered).
- Define **factions**, **locations**, and **recurring NPCs** at a campaign level.
- Optionally set **house rules** or toggles for automation (e.g., automatic recoil calculation).

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “I want to lay down the skeleton of my world before filling in the details.”

---

## 2. Scene & Session Building
- Create **Scenes** as modular narrative blocks:
  - Description, objectives, location, triggers.
  - Associated **NPCs**, **encounters**, **environmental effects**, and **loot/data rewards**.
- Assemble **Sessions** by selecting a sequence of scenes.
- Link notes, references, or clue threads to scenes (traceable later).

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “I should be able to reuse scenes or NPCs from other campaigns without rebuilding them.”

---

## 3. NPC Creation & Management
- Build **NPCs** using the same underlying system as PCs — with automation for:
  - Attributes, skills, gear, cyberware, spells.
  - Combat stats auto-calculated.
- Assign **tags** (e.g., “Ares”, “Fixer”, “Decking contact”) for quick lookup.
- Attach NPCs to scenes or campaign-level rosters.

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “Give me the crunch fast, but let me override it instantly if I want to change flavor or balance.”

---

## 4. Session Preparation
- Review upcoming session scenes in order.
- Add **session-specific notes**, pacing indicators, and possible outcomes.
- Flag key NPCs and active clues.
- Optionally simulate dice rolls or pre-plan key checks (like a matrix intrusion).

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “I want my prep to feel like setting up a dashboard before the mission.”

---

## 5. Live Session Mode
- Switch to **“Run Session”** mode:
  - Real-time dice automation (combat tracker, initiative, matrix actions).
  - Quick access to NPCs, gear, and scene info.
  - Auto-tracking of statuses, damage, and traceable intel.
- Log major outcomes automatically.

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “I want to focus on story beats, not crunching dice pools.”

---

## 6. Post-Session Management
- Session summary auto-saved (combat results, acquired items, learned intel).
- Adjust NPC statuses and campaign state.
- Add notes for next session and mark unresolved hooks.
- Optionally export to a campaign journal or timeline.

> 💡 *GM Perspective:* “Let me see the campaign evolve — who’s dead, who’s compromised, what the players learned.”
