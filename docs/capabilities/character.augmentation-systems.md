# Augmentation Systems Capability

## Purpose

The Augmentation Systems capability governs the physical and mental enhancement of character entities through technological and biological modification. It maintains the integrity of the character's metaphysical state (Essence) while providing a governed framework for the installation, modification, and lifecycle management of cybernetic and biological upgrades.

## Guarantees

- Every augmentation MUST result in a verifiable reduction in the character's Essence according to ruleset-defined multipliers.
- The system MUST enforce a permanent link between Essence loss and the reduction of a character's magical or resonance potential.
- Augmentations MUST provide measurable bonuses to character characteristics as defined by their grade and functional category.
- The system MUST maintain a persistent and auditable record of all installed modifications and their operational status.

## Requirements

### Essence and Metaphysical Integrity

- The system MUST track current Essence levels with high precision and enforce a mandatory minimum threshold for character viability.
- Essence expenditures MUST be calculated based on authoritative grade definitions (e.g., Used, Standard, Alpha, Beta, Delta).
- The system MUST implement an "Essence hole" mechanism for characters with magical or resonance paths to ensure that potential loss remains persistent even after augmentation removal.
- Total Essence loss MUST be reflected in the character's overall status and health records.

### Augmentation Governance

- The system MUST provide a catalog-driven selection process for various augmentation categories including headware, cyberlimbs, and bioware.
- Augmentations with multiple ratings MUST scale their Essence and resource costs according to ruleset-defined formulas.
- Cybernetic limbs MUST manage internal capacity constraints for secondary enhancements and specialized accessories.
- Post-creation management MUST support the addition, removal, and grade-level upgrading of installed systems.

### Functional Integration

- Bonuses from installed augmentations MUST be automatically propagated to the character's primary and derived statistics.
- The system MUST track the operational state of wireless-enabled augmentations to facilitate the application of situational bonuses.
- Real-time action mechanisms, such as initiative and limit calculations, MUST integrate with the active augmentation state.

## Constraints

- Augmented improvements MUST NOT exceed ruleset-defined maximums relative to the character's natural racial limits.
- The system MUST enforce availability and legality constraints for augmentations based on the character's current lifecycle stage (e.g., Creation vs. Active Play).
- Mutually exclusive augmentations MUST be identified and prevented by the system.

## Non-Goals

- This capability does not define the narrative or surgical procedures required for installation.
- This capability does not cover the visual or aesthetic representation of augmentations.
- This capability does not address the management of external gear or non-integrated technological devices.
