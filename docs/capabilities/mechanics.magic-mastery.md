# Magic Mastery Capability

## Purpose

The Magic Mastery capability guarantees the systematic integrity of supernatural traditions, spellcasting, and astral interactions. It ensures that all magical abilities are governed by edition-specific tradition requirements, drain mechanics, and resource budgets, providing a stable state for magical potential and its associated mechanical consequences.

## Guarantees

- Magical traditions MUST be authoritative and exclusively bound to their ruleset-defined attributes and codes of conduct.
- Spellcasting and ritual resolution MUST adhere to strictly defined drain formulas and resource expenditures.
- Astral presence and interaction states MUST be persistent and governed by the character's magical potential.
- The system MUST enforce a persistent link between Essence loss and the degradation of magical/resonance potential.

## Requirements

### Tradition and Potential

- The system MUST enforce mandatory tradition-specific attribute requirements during character initialization.
- Magical potential (Magic rating) MUST be constrained by both character-specific budgets and metatype-defined maximums.
- Transitions into magical advancement (e.g., Initiation) MUST satisfy all prerequisites and resource requirements.

### Spell and Power Mastery

- Every spell, ritual, and adept power MUST be bound to a verifiable ruleset definition.
- Allocation of spells and powers MUST be constrained by character-specific magical budgets and skill ratings.
- Mechanical effects of active magical states MUST be automatically propagated to relevant derived statistics.

### Drain and Resonance

- The system MUST provide Authoritative Drain calculations for all magical actions based on action-specific variables and character attributes.
- Cumulative magical fatigue or "burnout" states MUST be persistent and impact future magical resolution.

## Constraints

- A character MUST NOT possess magical potential if their Magic rating is zero or if they lack a defined tradition.
- Magical abilities MUST NOT be exercised if the character's current Essence state violates the tradition's minimum requirements.
- The use of magical content from incompatible ruleset bundles MUST be strictly prohibited.

## Non-Goals

- This capability does not define the visual presentation or icons for spells and traditions.
- This capability does not govern the narrative roleplaying aspects of different magical traditions.
- This capability does not manage the specific dice roll resolution logic (see Action Resolution).
