# Matrix Operations Capability

## Purpose

The Matrix Operations capability guarantees the systematic integrity of digital interactions, network navigation, and cyberdeck state. It ensures that all matrix-level actions are governed by edition-specific network protocols, program requirements, and hardware constraints, providing a stable and verifiable state for digital entities and their interactions within the global data grid.

## Guarantees

- Matrix identity and presence MUST be authoritative and bound to a specific hardware or persona identifier.
- Digital interactions MUST adhere to strictly defined network protocols and action economy rules per the active ruleset.
- Cyberdeck and program states MUST be persistent, governing the character's digital capabilities and limits.
- The accumulation of digital "System Identification Number" (SIN) noise or "Overwatch Score" MUST be auditable and result in predictable system interventions.

## Requirements

### Persona and Hardware

- The system MUST enforce mandatory hardware-specific attribute requirements (e.g., Cyberdeck arrays) during digital initialization.
- Matrix personas MUST be uniquely identified and linked to a verifiable source of digital authority.
- Hardware-specific limits (e.g., Data Processing, Firewall) MUST be automatically applied to all relevant matrix actions.

### Program and Utility Management

- Every matrix program and utility MUST be bound to a verifiable ruleset definition.
- Active program slots MUST be constrained by hardware-specific memory and processing limits.
- The system MUST automatically update digital potential based on active program modifications and hardware state transitions.

### Network Interaction

- The system MUST provide Authoritative resolution for matrix actions, including hacking, data search, and encryption resolution.
- Digital "marks" or authorization states MUST be persistent and verifiable throughout a matrix session.

## Constraints

- A character MUST NOT engage in matrix operations without a valid hardware interface or digital persona.
- Digital actions MUST NOT exceed the constraints defined by the character's current hardware and active program set.
- The use of matrix content from incompatible ruleset bundles MUST be strictly prohibited.

## Non-Goals

- This capability does not define the visual design of the matrix interface or host imagery.
- This capability does not govern the lore-specific history of the matrix or corporate data hosts.
- This capability does not manage the literal dice roll resolution logic (see Action Resolution).
