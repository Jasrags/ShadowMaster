# Social Governance Capability

## Purpose

The Social Governance capability guarantees the integrity of contact networks, social influence, and favor ledgers. It ensures that all social interactions are governed by edition-specific loyalty/connection metrics, networking constraints, and resource-driven influence resolution, providing a stable and verifiable state for a character's social capital and their associated network of assets.

## Guarantees

- Contact identities MUST be uniquely defined and bound to a persistent set of loyalty and connection attributes.
- Social interactions MUST adhere to strictly defined influence protocols and resource expenditures (e.g., spending Nuyen or Karma for favors) per the active ruleset.
- The "Favor Ledger" MUST be persistent and auditable, recording the accumulation and consumption of social capital within a campaign context.
- The system MUST enforce authoritative "Contact Fidelity" to ensure that assets remain consistent with their ruleset-defined capabilities and participant-defined relationship state.

## Requirements

### Network Initialization

- The system MUST enforce mandatory contact-specific attribute requirements (Loyalty/Connection) during character initialization.
- Contact networks MUST be persistent and discoverable, allowing for filtering by archetype, location, and specialization.
- Transitions in contact state (e.g., Loyalty increases, Burned contacts) MUST satisfy all prerequisites and resource requirements.

### Favor and Resource Management

- Every favor or social service MUST be bound to a verifiable ruleset-defined cost and risk profile.
- Allocation of social capital MUST be constrained by character-specific influence budgets and campaign-level availability.
- The mechanical consequences of social actions (e.g., successful networking, burned bridges) MUST be automatically propagated to the character's social state.

### Influence Resolution

- The system MUST provide Authoritative resolution for social actions, including networking, bribe resolution, and favor calling.
- Social capital "records" MUST be persistent and verifiable throughout a campaign's lifecycle.

## Constraints

- A character MUST NOT call upon a social contact without a defined loyalty/connection relationship.
- Social actions MUST NOT exceed the constraints defined by the character's current social capital and campaign visibility.
- The use of social content from incompatible ruleset bundles MUST be strictly prohibited.

## Non-Goals

- This capability does not define the visual icons or portraits for social contacts.
- This capability does not govern the narrative roleplaying dialogue or social roleplaying scripts.
- This capability does not manage the literal dice roll resolution logic (see Action Resolution).
