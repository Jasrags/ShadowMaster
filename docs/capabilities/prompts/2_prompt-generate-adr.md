Goal:
Convert the following rationale, tradeoff, or architectural choice from a specification or feature proposal into a formal Architecture Decision Record (ADR).

Instructions:

1. Structure the ADR using the following sections:
   - **Title:** Concise, descriptive name of the decision
   - **Decision:** Clearly state the chosen approach or solution
   - **Context:** Describe the background, constraints, and motivating factors
   - **Consequences:** Explain the results, risks, and tradeoffs of this decision
   - **Alternatives Considered:** List other options that were considered and why they were not chosen

2. Guidelines:
   - Focus on **why** the decision was made, not how it is implemented
   - Be **concise and declarative**
   - Remain **implementation-agnostic**
   - Ensure the ADR references any related capabilities
   - Produce content ready for `docs/decisions/<adr-name>.md`
