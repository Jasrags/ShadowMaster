Goal:
Convert a spec section into a capability contract.

Instructions:

- Maintain standard structure: Purpose, Guarantees, Requirements, Constraints, Non-Goals
- Use declarative language (MUST / MUST NOT / SHOULD)
- Keep Purpose abstract, outcome-focused; avoid procedural verbs like "coordinate", "manage", or "execute"
- Avoid implementation details, checklists, or progress indicators
- Subdivide Requirements into logical domains if multiple areas exist
- Simplify wording for clarity without losing precision

Input:
[Insert spec content here]
