# SR5 Character Creation Guide

This document contains comprehensive information extracted from the SR5 Character Creation pages, organized to help build a character creation flow.

## Overview

Shadowrun 5th Edition uses a **Priority System** for character creation. Players assign Priority Levels (A through E) to five categories:
1. Metatype
2. Attributes
3. Magic or Resonance
4. Skills
5. Resources

Each Priority Level can only be used once (no duplicates). Characters start with **25 Karma** to customize their character.

### Alternative: Karma Build Method

There is an optional ruleset for building characters (SR5:RF, page 64):
- Begin with 800 karma
- Purchase a Metatype
- Optionally buy a quality to use Magic or Resonance:
  - Adept (20 karma)
  - Aspected Magician (15 karma)
  - Magician (30 karma)
  - Mystic Adept (35 karma)
  - Technomancer (15 karma)
- Follow normal steps, buying with karma and exchanging 1 karma for 2,000 nuyen as needed

## Step 2: Metatype & Special Attributes

*Numbers in parentheses are Special Attribute Points*

### Metatype Selection

**Five Base Metatypes:**
- Human
- Elf
- Dwarf
- Ork
- Troll

Each metatype has:
- Starting attribute ratings
- Maximum attribute ratings
- Racial advantages/disadvantages
- Special attribute points (for Edge, Magic, Resonance)

**Metatype Considerations:**
- Review Metatype Attribute Table for starting values and maximums
- Consider racial advantages (e.g., trolls get Thermographic Vision, +1 Reach, Dermal Armor)
- Consider racial disadvantages (e.g., trolls pay +50% for gear and Lifestyle)
- Special attribute points can be spent on Edge, Magic, or Resonance
- Edge starts at metatype's base value (see Metatype Attribute Table)
- Magic and Resonance start at 0

### Special Attributes

**Special Attribute Points:**
- Can only be spent on Edge, Magic, or Resonance
- Cannot be used for Mental or Physical attributes
- Unspent points disappear after character creation
- If Priority gives 0 points, can use Karma to raise special attributes

**Maximum Ratings:**
- Most metatypes: Magic, Resonance, Edge max at 6
- Humans: Edge max at 7
- Qualities can exceed limits by 1:
  - Lucky (for Edge)
  - Exceptional Attribute (for any attribute, GM approval required)
- Cannot have both Lucky and Exceptional Attribute
- With Exceptional Attribute, can start with Magic/Resonance 7 (before initiation/submersion)

### Mental and Physical Attributes

**Attribute Points:**
- Spend all attribute points from Priority Table
- 1 point = +1 to attribute rating
- Start at metatype's base values (from Metatype Attribute Table)
- Can only have 1 Mental or Physical attribute at natural maximum limit
- Special attributes (Edge, Magic, Resonance) are exempt from this limit

**Important Calculations Based on Attributes:**
- **Initiative** = Intuition + Reaction
- **Inherent Limits** (see Step 8 formulas)
- **Living Persona** (for Technomancers) uses mental attributes
- **Astral Attributes** (for projecting magicians) based on mental attributes

---
