# Create Implementation Plan from GitHub Issue

1. Read the GitHub issue provided by the user
2. Use targeted grep searches (not broad exploration) to find relevant files - limit to 5-10 key files
3. Read existing similar implementations for patterns to follow
4. Write a concise implementation plan as a markdown checklist
5. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
6. Report: files to modify, estimated scope, and the plan

Keep exploration focused. Do NOT start implementing code.
