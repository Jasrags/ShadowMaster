Each spell is described with a set of characteristics.
Here’s a rundown of those categories and what the dif-
ferent abbreviations accompanying them mean.
Type: Spells are either Physical spells (P) or Mana
spells (M). For a full discussion of the difference between
the two, see the Physical vs. Mana sidebar (below).
Range: This describes how close you have to get,
or how far away you can be, to cast the spell. The most
common range is Line of Sight (LOS), meaning you have
to physically see the target (described in Step 2 of spell-
casting, p. 281). Some spells require you to Touch (T) the
target—if the target is unwilling, you’ll need to make an
unarmed attack against the target (see Accuracy, p. 168).
Some spells are Area spells, affecting an area rather
than a single target. These spells are noted with (A) after
the range designation. With a few exceptions, the area is
a radius in meters equal to the Force of the spell.
Damage: If the spell inflicts damage, this describes
the type—either Physical (P) or Stun (S). The Damage
Value for the spell is listed in the spell or spell category
description.
Duration: This describes how long the spell’s ef-
fect lasts. Instantaneous (I) spells have an effect that
happens and then fades, while Sustained (S) spells last
as long as you keep them going. Permanent (P) spells
don’t fade or dissipate; their effect becomes a lasting,
non-magical characteristic after you sustain the spell for
(Force) Combat Turns.
Drain: This is the formula used to calculate the Drain
Value inflicted by a spell. It is based on the Force (F) of
the spell and can never be below 2.
Some spells have keywords listed in parentheses.
These keywords are explained in the description of the
spell category.

COMBAT SPELLS
EXAMPLE
Combat spells use mana to create damaging effects,
either by direct or indirect means. They’re a mana-sling-
er’s guns, and are treated that way by law enforcement.
Direct: When your direct combat spell is success-
fully cast, it inflicts a number of boxes of damage equal
to your net hits on the opposed test. The opposed test
generally pits your Spellcasting + Magic [Force] against
either Body (for physical spells) or Willpower (for mana
spells). The target does not get to resist the damage,
only the Spellcasting test.
Indirect: All indirect combat spells originate near the
magician’s body (most magicians use their hands or eyes,
but some use their feet for “power kicks” or emanate
power from the entire body for a kind of an aura-throw-
ing effect). The spell then is launched with an Opposed
Test that pits the magician’s Spellcasting + Magic [Force]
versus the target’s Reaction + Intuition, kind of like shoot-
ing a gun (in this case with bullets made of acid, or fire,
or something equally unpleasant to be hit by). So you
don’t really need to be able to see the target—you can
cast these spells blindfolded or with artificial image en-
hancement—as long as you’ve got a clear line of fire. The
Damage Value of a successful indirect combat spell is
Force + net hits, with an AP equal to –(Force). Damage
from an indirect combat spell is resisted with Body +
Armor (adjusted for the spell’s AP). Area indirect spells
travel from the magician to the point of detonation and
then go boom. The test is like that for grenades (p. 181):
a Spellcasting + Magic [Force] (3) Test with scatter of 2D6
meters. Unlike grenades, you get to add your net hits on
this test to the Damage Value of the spell, but only if you
beat the threshold; otherwise the spell still detonates, but
the hits are used to reduce scatter by one meter per hit..
Elemental: These spells cause extra damage (Spe-
cial Damage Types, p. 170). The specific type is listed in
the spell description.



Spell categories
Combat spells: These spells are quick, dirty, and violent.
The energy of the spell is used to harm, maim, or
otherwise frag the target. Spell energy may be
channeled directly into the target, damaging it from
within, or it may generate external energy to damage
the target from the outside.
Detection spells: These spells enhance the senses. They
allow the subject of the spell to see or hear over great
distances, or grant new sensory abilities. There are
also Detection spells to sense the presence of other
beings, magic, life, and/or enemies.
Health spells: These spells affect the condition and
performance of a living body. They can be used to treat
or heal injuries, purge poisons or toxins, and increase
or decrease Attributes.
Illusion spells: These spells can mess with a target’s
perception. They can be used to deceive, make things
invisible, confuse the senses, or provide simple or
complex entertainments.
Manipulation spells: These spells are used by magicians
to alter and shape their environment in a variety of
ways. Manipulation spells can control the emotions
or actions of a person, move objects, shape, create,
or channel energy, or change a target’s form or
appearance by altering its structure.
