# Combat Actions

## Unclassified Actions

| Action | Type | Description | Source |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| Delaying Action | Unclassified | A character can delay their action to act later in the Initiative Pass. Must be declared during Step 3A. Character can choose to go before, after, or at the same time as a currently acting character at a specific Initiative Score. Actions taken receive a –1 dice pool penalty. Character keeps their initial Initiative Score. If character does not act before the end of the Initiative Pass, they incur the standard reduction of 10 at the end of the Initiative Pass. | SR5 |
| Walking | Unclassified | A character can move up to their Walking rate (Agility×2) per Combat Turn without taking any actions. Moving beyond this rate requires the character to Run or Sprint. | SR5 |

## Free Actions

| Action | Type | Description | Source |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| Call a Shot | Free | A character may call a shot (aim for a vulnerable portion of a target) with this Free Action. This action must be combined with a Fire Weapon, Throw Weapon, or Melee Attack Action. See Called Shots. | SR5 |
| Change Linked Device Mode | Free | A character may use a Free Action to activate, deactivate, or switch the mode on any device that they are linked to by a direct neural interface through either a wired or wireless link. This includes activating cyberware, changing a smartgun's firing mode, changing a smartlinked shotgun's choke, deactivating thermographic vision, switching a commlink to hidden mode, turning a device's wireless functionality off, and so on. | SR5 |
| Deactivate Focus | Free | You can deactivate a focus at any time with a Free Action. | SR5 |
| Drop Object | Free | A character may drop a held object as a Free Action. If holding an object in each hand, they may drop both objects as a single Free Action. At the gamemaster's discretion, dropped items may suffer damage from being dropped if they are fragile or dropped in a hostile environment. | SR5 |
| Drop Prone | Free | A character may kneel or drop prone as a Free Action, as long as they are not surprised. A character who is surprised may not drop prone. | SR5 |
| Eject Smartgun Clip | Free | A character linked to a ready smartgun may use a mental command to eject the weapon's clip. It still takes a separate Simple Action to insert a new, fresh clip. | SR5 |
| Gesture | Free | A character may communicate with a few quick gestures as a Free Action. Characters unfamiliar with the gestures may make an Intuition (2) Test to determine what the gesture means. | SR5 |
| Multiple Attacks | Free | A character may use a Free Action to attack multiple targets in a single action by splitting their dice pool. This action must be combined with a Fire Weapon Action, Throw Weapon Action, Melee Attack Action, Reckless Spellcasting, or Cast Spell Action. See Multiple Attacks (p. 196). | SR5 |
| Run | Free | Running uses a Free Action and inflicts Running movement modifiers. Running is any movement that exceeds the character's Walking Movement Rate in a single Combat Turn. | SR5 |
| Speak/Text/Transmit Phrase | Free | One short phrase of verbal communication is a Free Action. If the character wants to speak more, each additional phrase or sentence requires a Free Action. The gamemaster should be careful to control excessive, unrealistic conversations within the span of a single action during a 3-second Combat Turn. Characters who are equipped to send text messages through a direct neural interface connection with their commlink may also send short messages as a Free Action. | SR5 |

## Intervention Actions (Interrupt Actions)

Intervention Actions (also called Interrupt Actions) allow a character to take an action outside their allotted Action Phase. When a character uses an Interrupt Action, they take an action out of turn, but only if they have enough Initiative Score left in the Combat Turn to pay the price for the action. Interrupt Actions occur outside the normal course of the Combat Turn and do not cost the character their Action Phase (unless they reduce their Initiative Score below 0 with their actions). The Initiative Score reduction occurs at the time of the Interrupt Action. A character may only take an Interrupt Action prior to their first Action Phase if they are not surprised.

| Action | Type | Initiative Cost | Description | Source |
|--------|------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Block | Interrupt | -5 Initiative Score | A character may choose to use their own unarmed combat skill to block incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action. By decreasing their Initiative Score, the defending character can add their Unarmed Combat skill to their defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense which lasts for an entire Combat Turn. | SR5 |
| Dodge | Interrupt | -5 Initiative Score | A character may choose to use their own skill to dodge incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. By decreasing their Initiative Score, the defending character can add their Gymnastics skill to the defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense which lasts for an entire Combat Turn. | SR5 |
| Full Defense | Interrupt | -10 Initiative Score | A character may choose to focus on deliberately avoiding incoming attacks as an Interrupt Action. This action adds the character's Willpower to their Defense tests for the entire Combat Turn. Full Defense actions may be taken at any time, even before the character's Action Phase as an Interrupt Action, as long as the character is not surprised. Characters may only go on Full Defense if they have enough Initiative Score left in that Combat Turn. The bonus gained in this manner is kept until the end of the Combat Turn so a character can choose to fight defensively early in the round by decreasing their Initiative Score to increase their defense. This bonus is also cumulative with other Interrupt Actions. | SR5 |
| Hit the Dirt | Interrupt | -5 Initiative Score | A character who has already used their Free Action may choose to drop prone when caught by suppressive fire using this action. The defending character doesn't need to make the Reaction + Edge test but is considered prone on their next Action Phase. If the suppressive fire continues, the defending character needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up, risking getting shot, or fight from the ground. If the suppressive fire has stopped the prone character still needs to use a Stand Up Simple Action to get back up. | SR5 |
| Intercept | Interrupt | -5 Initiative Score | A character may take an Interrupt Action to intercept an opponent who attempts to move past them within 1 meter (+1 meter per point of Reach) or break out of melee combat with them. The Intercept Action allows a character to make a melee attack out of turn. If the character does not have enough Initiative Score left that Action Phase, they cannot intercept. If the opponent has a melee weapon ready, they use their normal melee weapon skill rating; otherwise, they use the Unarmed Combat skill. If the character is wielding a firearm they may choose to use the weapon as a club and attack with the Club skill. This attack follows all of the normal rules for Melee Combat. If, after their Resistance Test, the character attempting to pass takes damage equal to their Body, they are intercepted and cannot continue their movement. Prone combatants cannot intercept. With a little room to move, agile characters can avoid the Interception attempts of their opponents without engaging in combat. Using a Complex Action with their movement, they can make an Agility + Gymnastics [Physical] Test. Each hit above the threshold allows the character to move past one opponent. | SR5 |
| Parry | Interrupt | -5 Initiative Score | A character may choose to use their own melee weapon skill to deflect incoming melee attacks as an Interrupt Action. By decreasing their Initiative Score, the defending character can add their melee weapon skill to their defense test. This is a one-time add, unlike going on Full Defense, which lasts for an entire Combat Turn. Bonus die, such as die from a relevant weapon foci, can be added to this test. | SR5 |
