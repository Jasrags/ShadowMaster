Based on your analysis, create a comprehensive API documentation file that:
1. Lists all endpoints with full specifications (method, path, auth requirements)
2. Documents request/response schemas with examples
3. Captures validation rules for each endpoint
4. Notes any Shadowrun-specific business logic
5. Documents error responses

Format as `/docs/claude/api-specification.md`
